Audience \u2693\ufe0e New users \u2693\ufe0e The documentation is laid out in a user friendly way. It caters to beginners and other people new to Linux, and helps you get running quickly. Installing Linux can seem daunting at first, because there are a lot of new concepts, choices, and options. Choice is good, but it can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing. Initially, the installation instruction will cover only the necessary options and configuration choices to help you quickly set up a running system with defaults suitable for daily use. With the system running and productive you can learn how to perform different routine system tasks such as installing apps, adjusting the system settings, or customizing openSUSE. And, if you're so inclined, start honing your Linux skills. Experienced users \u2693\ufe0e For experienced Linux users the documentation includes short pointers on how things are done in openSUSE and how things are different to other Linux distros. Links to advanced topics are provided to get you acquainted with the system, and quickly up and running. Summary \u2693\ufe0e This documentation has three main parts. Each part (and most sections within it) can be read independently from the rest and can be used as a guide for accomplishing a specific task. However we have tried to make each part into a coherent whole, which can thus be read in a more linear fashion, in the order in which the contents are presented. Part I: Before installing \u2693\ufe0e The pre-install documentation gives you everything you need to get a system running. This can be a simple installation using default settings, or you can make a few choices, such as choosing a desktop environment. You can find out more about things like desktop environments in this section.

The openSUSE distributions are no exception: the official and unofficial repositories, which you interact with from zypper, and which provide binaries packaged as RPMs files third-party providers, which you interact with from a command prompt through wget or curl or git , and which either provide you with a complete installation solution, including binaries and installation scripts, or include just the source files along with build scripts flatpaks , which you typically interact with from the flatpak command line utility, providing you containerized applications along with all their dependencies Ubuntu snaps , which you install from the snapd command line utility, providing you (just like flatpaks) containerized applications with their dependencies AppImages , which you manually download from websites and various hosts, providing you with a single executable file which your system will treat as an application, much like what you would see in a macOS environment The goal of this document is to help you understand these various formats and methods, as well as their strong and weak points, so that you can seamlessly include them in your daily usage. Assuming you are using an openSUSE distribution, we will make a few recommendations specific to these distributions along the way. Official and third-party repositories (.rpm) \u2693\ufe0e .rpm packages are the traditional and most common way of obtaining new software on openSUSE distributions. You are likely already familiar with the method for obtaining these packages, but to be sure: Find the repository providing the package you are looking for. If the package is provided by an official repository, such as http://download.opensuse.org/update/tumbleweed/, (use zypper lr -d to show the exact endpoint of all your repositories), then the desired package will show up in zypper search <package_name> . If the package is not provided by an official repository, you will need to first add the repository. Install the target package with sudo zypper in <package_name> . In certain cases you won't know the exact name of the package, so after adding the corresponding repository you can simply do sudo zypper dup to make sure that the package is installed among all the pending updates. Detailed instructions for external repositories \u2693\ufe0e Certain application providers provide you with an .rpm file that will automatically add the require repository and install the desired application. When so you can simply point zypper to the said file and install from there, as in: cd ~/Downloads sudo zypper in <package>.rpm When doing so make sure the package is safe and the provider trustworthy. Most trustworthy providers sign their .rpm s with cryptographic keys, providing you with an .asc file containing a public key. You can the use the public key to verify the package, as in: $ rpm --import <the-package-public-key>.asc $ rpm --checksig <the-rpm-package-file>.rpm We recommend making sure that third-party repositories for the applications you use the most be added with the refresh setting enabled, as in: $ sudo zypper addrepo --refresh <host_address> On some configurations not doing so might result in sudo zypper dup not automatically acquiring new updates for the package provided by that repository. You can make sure your repositories refresh automatically by listing them and paying attention at the (r) column -- the last -- obtained from zypper lr . Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Pros : the most 'natural' way to install programs in the openSUSE ecosystem has the best performance (startup time + execution speed) of all solutions has the smallest footprint on your RAM and hard drive Cons : heavily depends the libraries and other dependencies provided by your operating system, which means that drastic changes in your system-wide dependencies might prevent the program from running at all depends on the availability of the distribution's packagers and maintainers, as opposed to solutions \"closer\" to the developers or that can benefit from cross-distribution maintainership ( flatpaks , AppImages , Ubuntu snaps ) Go for it when : you are aiming for core utilities or libraries (e.g. curl , gcc , python-devel ) and you know beforehand that you won't need to have several versions of these installed at the same time you need maximal performance / minimal footprint you can afford a marginally slower update pace than with other solutions Third-party remote providers \u2693\ufe0e We call third-party remote providers as a catch-all term for websites, services or remote machines offering you an automatic installation solution provided by installation scripts provided along with the desired application. Since all the details fo the installation depends on custom made installation scripts, your experience with this method can vary significantly from one provider to another. Here your best bet is to thoroughly follow the instructions mentioned by the provider. For example, installing the Rust developer stack is a simple as copy-pasting into your command line the line: $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh and following the interactive instructions. Warning Installation scripts might require sudo rights, so be mindful about what you are installing, and who you are installing from. Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Pros : has the best performance (startup time + execution speed) of all solutions has the smallest footprint on your RAM and hard drive Cons : no control over the behaviour of the script -- especially if the script asks to be run as sudo -- which may incur some risk heavily depends the libraries and other dependencies provided by your operating system, which means that drastic changes in your system-wide dependencies might prevent the program from running at all depends on the availability of the distribution's packagers and maintainers, as opposed to solutions \"closer\" to the developers or that can benefit from cross-distribution maintainership ( flatpaks , AppImages , Ubuntu snaps ) Go for it when : you are 100% sure you can trust the provider you are aiming for core utilities or libraries (e.g. curl , gcc , python-devel ) and you know beforehand that you won't need to have several versions of these installed at the same time you need maximal performance / minimal footprint you can afford a marginally slower update pace than with other solutions Flatpaks \u2693\ufe0e Flatpak is a complete solution for installing, updating and running desktop applications from a containerized environment. It makes use of the following components: the flatpak command line utility a remote application store at https://flathub.org/home application references, such as com.spotify.Client , organized by the flathub store a local repository used to store applications along with their dependencies (by default, /var/lib/flatpak ) On openSUSE distributions, you can install flatpak as follows: Install the command line utility (not required if it's installed already; to double-check see if flatpak --version returns something): $ sudo zypper in flatpak Add the flathub store as flatpak external repository: $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo And finally restart your system. From now on you will be able to install any of the very numerous apps provided from flathub , as in: $ flatpak install --user flathub com.spotify.Client Two things are important to bear in mind: Using the --user flag is recommended for this reason: if the user has a separate /home and installs flatpaks using the --user flag, these applications will remain even after the entire file system is reinstalled, which means that the installed flatpaks can be reused after restoring the system. Installing applications (with or without --user should automatically export a .desktop file to /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications and add the corresponding symlinks to your system. This means applications will show up in your desktop environment's application launchers and other menus right after you have installed them (no reboot required). Updating your flatpaks is then as easy as: $ flatpak update To update a single flatpak application, do instead: $ flatpak update <the.application.name> Additional details \u2693\ufe0e How it works \u2693\ufe0e The two main themes behind flatpaks are binary versioning control and containerization . Binary versioning control (BVC) ensures that the system sees flatpak applications not just as a bunch of files with a given name, but in a way that tracks them against the context of a full versioning control system, such as Git. Flatpak applications are thus much like Git branches, in that they \"wear their orgin up their sleeves\". For example, the complete reference of the Spotify application on my machine as of this writing is: $ flatpak list Spotify com.spotify.Client 1.1.55.498.gf9a83c60 stable system which amounts to, in this order: a human-friendly name, the exact name as fixed by the provider, the (git) snapshot it is built from, the (git) branch hosting the snapshot (here stable ), as well as the installation site on my machine (here, it is installed for the system , which means it can be run by any other user on my machine.) Under this constraint, any difference in the name or snapshot or branch or installation site will determine a different flatpak application reference. Two applications that are byte-for-byte identical will not collide with one another if they are different under other aspects of their reference. This means that, at any point, you can identify the portion of the codebase from which the application stems and that is relevant to the binary you are running. This also means you can have multiple versions of \"the same\" application through multiple application references. The other main theme behind flatpaks is containerization. Here it means that flatpak applications run in isolation from one another. This is made possible by taking advantage of the binary versioning control system mentioned above. Indeed, flatpak allows developers to specify a particular runtime for their app, which is the context against which their applications is to run, and that serves as a proxy for the full operating system. Because of BVC developers are free to specify different runtimes for the same byte-to-byte identical binaries, or conversely, the same runtime for widely different binaries, should they happen to have similar requirements. The flatpak system then makes sure that runtimes meet the requirements of the applications they are associated with by their developers, and are executing in mutually inaccessible memory spaces. Info Even though the sharing of runtimes means that flatpak applications will share some of their dedependencies, there is no reliable way of ensuring that all their dependencies are thus shared, or that a developer has specified the same runtime as the one specified by the developers of the other flatpak applications installed by the user. This means that some duplication is to be expected, wasting some disk space. Improving desktop integration (KDE Plasma) \u2693\ufe0e The degree of independence that flatpaks enjoy with respect to the host operating system means that some frictions may occur now and then. This is particularily true for applications (or for runtimes) which do not always play nice with recent rendering and compositing frameworks. For example, drag-dropping a file for sending via a messaging application run as flatpak might not work as seamlessly as exepcted. For these corner cases, there is not much choice but to tinker with the runtime's parameters. Consider for example org.telegram.desktop . Should your version of this app seem to be affected by the above bug, you can try to run the application as: $ flatpak run --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop which basically instructs the runtime to use X11 instead of Wayland as the compositing client. They are countless other environment parameters you can use, and the right approach is usually to read the documentation and Git Issues of your favorite flatpak applications. Info Every single flatpak has is a public repository (often on GitHub) where you read Issues and participate to the conversation. Do not hesitate to go there now and then, as the tips you might learn are likely to serve you for many other flatpak applications. When you are satisfied with the results, you can attach a runtime setting to an application permanently to the current user as in: $ flatpak override --user --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop (Remove the --user flag to apply the override system-wide.) This will ensure that the application is always run with the corresponding environment parameter. More on the override option in the official Flatpak documentation . Flatseal \u2693\ufe0e Please refer to Flatseal's official documentation . Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Pros : decent performance (it runs as fast as \"bare\" binaries and launches almost as fast) excellent safety for your operating system (because most dependencies are not shared with the host operating system and because flatpaks installed with --user survive system reinstallations/restorations) easy to update ( flatpak update ) Cons : eats up significantly more hard drive space than the alternative methods and formats (because not all dependencies can be shared between flatpaks) sometimes rough around the edges in terms of integration with the desktop environment Go for it when : you are using many applications with a graphical interface and you don't want to expose them or your system to conflicts of dependencies (useful for Tumbleweed and microOS, whose core packages change frequently) you want to have freshly updated and widely tested applications (the same as most other Linux distributions) you plan on using many user applications (the more flatpaks you have, the more dependencies they can share) Snaps \u2693\ufe0e Warning Please help finish this section.

Pros, cons, when \u2693\ufe0e Warning Please help finish this section. Summary and conclusion \u2693\ufe0e Even though Leap and Tumbleweed's official repositories are numerous, you will find yourself in search of alternatives at times. Here are some simple rules of thumbs that emerge from the Pros and cons discussed above: If you are looking for a program with a graphical interface that... updates often; or relies on very recent dependencies; or requires you to install dependencies that: are provided by the official repositories; but differ in version from those provided by the official repositories; then you will be better off using ; then snaps, flapaks or appimages offer you serious alternatives to official repositories, which may update less frequently. This applies to both Leap and Tumbleweed's official repositories. When wondering which to use, between snaps, flatpaks and appimages: favour flatpaks if you want a streamlined experience or precise maintenance options via the command line or if you plan on using several other flatpaks (the more flatpaks, the most cost-efficient the sacrifice of storage space they demand) favour appimages if you need a handful of \"fire-and-forget\" or \"portable\" (no installation needed) applications.

For example, drag-dropping a file for sending via a messaging application run as flatpak might not work as seamlessly as exepcted. For these corner cases, there is not much choice but to tinker with the runtime's parameters. Consider for example org.telegram.desktop . Should your version of this app seem to be affected by the above bug, you can try to run the application as: $ flatpak run --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop which basically instructs the runtime to use X11 instead of Wayland as the compositing client. They are countless other environment parameters you can use, and the right approach is usually to read the documentation and Git Issues of your favorite flatpak applications. Info Every single flatpak has is a public repository (often on GitHub) where you read Issues and participate to the conversation. Do not hesitate to go there now and then, as the tips you might learn are likely to serve you for many other flatpak applications. When you are satisfied with the results, you can attach a runtime setting to an application permanently to the current user as in: $ flatpak override --user --env=QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb org.telegram.desktop (Remove the --user flag to apply the override system-wide.) This will ensure that the application is always run with the corresponding environment parameter.

This applies to both Leap and Tumbleweed's official repositories. When wondering which to use, between snaps, flatpaks and appimages: favour flatpaks if you want a streamlined experience or precise maintenance options via the command line or if you plan on using several other flatpaks (the more flatpaks, the most cost-efficient the sacrifice of storage space they demand) favour appimages if you need a handful of \"fire-and-forget\" or \"portable\" (no installation needed) applications.","title":"Summary and conclusion"},{"location":"alternative_procurement/#references","text":"Comparison between AppImage, Flatpak and Ubuntu Snap: https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Similar-projects#comparison","title":"References"},{"location":"best_of_post/","text":"Our \"post installation\" best of \u2693\ufe0e Some of the material covered below is presented and discussed in more details elsewhere in this documentation.

We personally recommend fish and zsh , both of which provide auto-completion for commands you have previously used and commands that are provided by the programs that the shell has discovered (including file paths!). fish is a bit more friendly to the beginner, whereas zsh is more feature-ful and implements a protocol that is a bit closer to the one use by the built-in shell ( bash ). Refer to the documentation provided by the developers to make your favorite shell the default. Also, don't overlook aliases -- user-defined synonyms for shell commands. You won't regret creating a few aliases should you need a command that you don't remember from a tty console.

Some of these parameters are key to a comfortable user experience. Consider for example Electron apps, which as of today (26th of July 2021) offload rendering to X11 instead of the Wayland client. This means that your Desktop Environment, which is likely to run with Wayland enabled by default, will not be able to make the most of the application's GUI. We can improve the situation as follows: Locate the application's desktop file, most likely at /usr/share/applications . For instance you can go a simple: $ ls /usr/share/applications | grep <program name>.desktop Once you're certain of the file name, copy it to ~/.local/share/applications : $ cp /usr/share/applications/<program name>.desktop ~/.local/share/applications There you can edit the program's .desktop file at leisure as it won't be overwritten when updating the target program (this contrasts with editing .desktop files directly under /usr/share/applications . For instance if you wanted VS Code -- an Electron application -- to use Wayland, you could change the line: Exec=/usr/share/code/code --unity-launch %F to Exec=/usr/share/code/code --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland It might take a reboot for your applications to register changes to their .desktop file. Codecs \u2693\ufe0e openSUSE distributions do not ship with proprietary software, and for most cases there are Free and Open Source alternatives, such as the free codecs shipped with certain applications (most modern web browsers such as the Chromium-based ones and Firefox).

To do this we recommend using the opi -- Open Build Service Package Installer, which is able to fetch software sitting just outside of the official system repositories: sudo zypper in opi opi codecs Notice that some applications come packaged with proprietary codecs; that is the case for VLC for instance. If you install these applications from the official repositories you don't need to install codecs manually. Set up your GPU driver \u2693\ufe0e Check out the following documentation for this step: single GPUs integrated + dedicated GPUs Use a password manager \u2693\ufe0e KDE's kwallet and gnome-keyring are decent password managers as far as storing identifiers meant to be consumed by third-party applications, but some users might feel they fall short when it comes at providing a comfortable interface for auto-completion and daily management (especially the latter).

The switch can be more or less fine-grained. Fine-grained switches, such as the ones used in Kdenlive and OBS Studio , are able to use VAAPI and NVENC to offload specific processes of encoding/decoding to the dedicated GPU, while a coarse-grained switch would have to offload an entire program instead. Some hardware configurations have a multiplexer ( mux ), a hardware switch that can be configured from the machine's UEFI to select the main graphics processor. A multiplexer is to be preferred if your hardware has one, as it performs better since there is no render offloading involved. This matters especially for users without external monitors, as the HDMI and DisplayPort outputs are usually connected directly to the dedicated GPU. Switching the multiplexer to the dedicated GPU or using an external monitor would thus offer better performance than using the built-in monitor or offloading the rendering to the dedicated GPU. Update your system before proceeding to the next steps: sudo zypper dup Dedicated NVIDIA GPU \u2693\ufe0e To use an external monitor or be able to offload rendering to the NVIDIA GPU, you'll need to follow the next steps. The external monitor will work when you switch to the NVIDIA GPU. This section applies to users interested in the proprietary NVIDIA driver. Getting the necessary software \u2693\ufe0e Install the correct Nvidia driver . Install the suse-prime package using zypper or YaST. If you want to install via zypper run the following command in a terminal session: sudo zypper in suse-prime . Users on NVIDIA graphic cards released before GeForce 600 series should instead install suse-prime-bbswitch . Info In case you are using KDE, a widget called SUSE Prime Selector can be added as graphical way to switch graphics. You can install it with the command sudo zypper in plasma5-applet-suse-prime . See the next sections according to your integrated and dedicated GPU combination. Alternatively, to offload rendering to the dedicated GPU (NVIDIA Optimus), see Offloading specific applications to the NVIDIA GPU . This allows you to use both graphical units simultaneously. Intel and NVIDIA \u2693\ufe0e Either one of these two options: From a terminal session: to switch to the NVIDIA GPU run sudo prime-select nvidia ; conversely, for the Intel GPU run sudo prime-select intel . After executing either command, log out and back on to apply the changes. With the KDE widget SUSE Prime Selector , just click it and select Switch to NVidia . Then log out and back in and you should be set. AMD APU and NVIDIA \u2693\ufe0e When using XOrg 1.20.6 or higher: to make the APU the primary GPU and have the ability to offload specific applications to the dedicated GPU, you can skip to the offloading section below. If you are using an older release of XOrg, such as the case for Leap 15.2, or you wish to exclusively use the NVIDIA card, pick between the following steps: To enable only the NVIDIA GPU, run sudo prime-select nvidia from the command line. To enable the AMD GPU, run sudo prime-select unset . After executing either command, log out and back on to apply the changes. Offloading specific applications to the Nvidia GPU \u2693\ufe0e Warning: This section only applies to users with the propietary driver and NVIDIA GeForce 600 series or higher utilizing the nvidia-glG05 driver package. With the integrated Intel GPU or AMD APU set as your main GPU, you can also offload specific applications using an envoronment variable. For example, to run supertuxkart using the the NVIDIA driver, you can launch it from a terminal session as follows: __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only supertuxkart To offload a game from Steam using the NVIDIA driver, you can modify properties of the game, by right clicking it, going to Properties choosing Set Launch Options and adding a line like this: __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only %command% For the offload process to work properly on integrated Intel cards, make sure the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-intel.conf exists. If you do not have it, enable the NVIDIA card once and switch back to the integrated GPU; the required file will be created automatically along the way. Note that this only applies to XOrg sessions. If everything worked out fine for you, feel free to copy and modify the .desktop files of your more demanding programs (like MATLAB or Octave) and append the enviroment variables to the Exec section of the file: Exec=__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only /usr/bin/octave --gui %f This makes the desired program offload to the dedicated GPU everytime you launch it from the shortcut.

The switch can be more or less fine-grained. Fine-grained switches, such as the ones used in Kdenlive and OBS Studio , are able to use VAAPI and NVENC to offload specific processes of encoding/decoding to the dedicated GPU, while a coarse-grained switch would have to offload an entire program instead. Some hardware configurations have a multiplexer ( mux ), a hardware switch that can be configured from the machine's UEFI to select the main graphics processor. A multiplexer is to be preferred if your hardware has one, as it performs better since there is no render offloading involved. This matters especially for users without external monitors, as the HDMI and DisplayPort outputs are usually connected directly to the dedicated GPU. Switching the multiplexer to the dedicated GPU or using an external monitor would thus offer better performance than using the built-in monitor or offloading the rendering to the dedicated GPU.

Most users are used to Live images, packing a full-blown environment where they can test out a Linux distribution before installing. Note Users interested in Tumbleweed should bear in mind that, because of the way Tumbleweed is built, Tumbleweed Live images are missing a handful of tests in comparison to Tumbleweed DVD images (see below). So even if Live images can be considered reasonably safe for most users, we cannot guarantee the same quality assurance as for DVD images. Our live images (~950 MBs) provide the following desktop environments: KDE GNOME XFCE They each come in different flavours tailor-suited to your CPU architecture: x86_64 (64-bit) i686 (32-bit) aarch64 (Armv8-A \"ARM\" 64-bit) The two other installation media we provide are DVD images and Network installer. DVD images are quite bulky (~4.5 GBs), but allow you to install an entire distribution without relying on network for retrieving components. Networks installers are much lighter (~150 MBs); they require a stable and hopefully fast connection to fetch components over the network. Authenticity & integrity checks (*NIX) \u2693\ufe0e Note The following two steps are optional, but are considered good practice. You perform an integrity check when you want to make sure that a given file has not been tampered with. It typically involves making sure that a file's checksum matches a certain target. You perform an authenticity check when you want to make sure that a file -- typically the file that specifies the checksum target -- was obtained from a legitimate source (i.e. openSUSE). Because performing an integrity check against an inauthentic target does not make sense, you want to first do an authenticity check, and only then do an integrity check. Assumptions & definitions \u2693\ufe0e In what follows we make the following assumptions: You have downloaded an openSUSE Live, Network or DVD image from openSUSE website (hereafter: the Image ): Tumbleweed Leap You have obtained the Target Checksum file for your image, by clicking on the Checksum next to the image. You have obtained openSUSE gpg Public Key by importing it via its keyid into your gpg keyring with $ gpg --recv-keys 0x22C07BA534178CD02EFE22AAB88B2FD43DBDC284 You have obtained an openSUSE gpg Detached Signature file corresponding to the image you want to perform the check upon. The Tumbleweed detached signature files are held within a single directory here . Regarding Leap however you need to start there and use the /live subdirectory for the live images and the rescue images (the /iso subdirectory does not provide any detached signature for net installers and DVD images). Once you have the address of the signature file, the command looks like this (i.e. for KDE Live): $ wget http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-KDE-Live-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256.asc Authenticity check \u2693\ufe0e For Tumbleweed (all images) and Leap (only live images) the authenticity check is an instance of the command: $ gpg --verify <Detached Signature.asc> <Target Checksum.iso.sha256> For Leap non-live images (typically DVD images) the authenticity check uses no signature (clearsign check); it is an instance of the command: $ gpg --verify <Target Checksum.iso.sha256> The check passes just in case the command outputs calls it a success. Warning If the check fails, make sure you are honoring our assumptions . Integrity check \u2693\ufe0e It is an instance of the command: $ sha256sum <Image.iso> The check passes just in case the output of the above equals the checksum written in plain text in the Target Checksum (see Definitions & assumptions ). Authenticity and integrity checks (Windows 10) \u2693\ufe0e Preparation : 1. Download the filename.iso.sha256 file from the Download section of opensuse.org or download the hash files from here for Tumbleweed: https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256 for Leap: https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.3/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.3-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256 Note that it does not matter where exactly you put the files as long as they are all in the same folder and keep their original names. Then browse to https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html and download and install the Windows installer for GnuPG. Info For the purposes of this guide it does not matter whether you install the program as administrator or not, so just click yes to install to install without administrator rights if it asks you. Find the folder containing the files you downloaded in the first step, hold Shift while right-clicking it (the folder, not the files in it). Select it to open a command window. Use whichever command line utility you've got available, but if you used the PowerShell option, type cmd followed by Enter in the command prompt. Integrity Check \u2693\ufe0e Locate the folder of the downloaded ISO image Open a command prompt. cd to the folder and finally type this command, confirming the command with Enter : CertUtil -hashfile <filename>.iso SHA256 # replace <filename> with the actual name of your ISO image Example: certutil -hashfile openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Snapshot20210611-Media.iso SHA256 Note that if you start typing a filename you can press Tab to automatically complete it. This will take a little while to complete and eventually present you with an alphanumeric sequence that is called a hash. If this hash is identical to the one listed in your filename.iso.sha256 then the integrity check passed. You can compare them by hand (note that some Windows text editors will not display the line breaks in that document so it may look weirdly formatted) or better use the find command. If the same hash is not found in <file_name>.iso.sha256 , then your downloaded ISO image did not pass the integrity check. Make sure you downloaded the correct <file_name>.iso.sha256 and if yes, try to download the ISO image again from a different mirror server. Try on it the integrity again. Info On older versions of Windows, the CertUtil command does not exist. Instead it is recommended to install 7zip from https://www.7-zip.org/, then find and right-click the .iso file your downloaded in Windows Explorer and select 7-Zip's CRC SHA option to calculate the SHA 256 hash, which must then compare to the one from the filename.iso.sha256 file yourself. Warning Never install from an .iso that failed the integrity check. Authenticity Check \u2693\ufe0e To perform the authenticity check of the ISO image, obtain the official GPG public key and SHA256 hash file from here (http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/) of your required openSUSE iso version. Download the required \"filename.iso.sha256.asc\" and \"filename.iso.sha256\" file and save it named with \"sha256sum.txt.gpg\" and \"sha256sum.txt\" in one folder. (Note: ISO file and these two .txt file should be in one folder). You can then perform the check from a command prompt. gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt {Message for you Ad: you can attach a image of the result of this command line} As long as it says Good signature from \"openSUSE Tumbleweed ISO Signing Key root@opensuse.org \" and with a fingerprint matching the one shown above and that you used to download the key, then that means your download is authentic. In case it was tampered with the message would be BAD signature from .... You can ignore the warning that comes after that, it is expected and perfectly normal. Get to the installer \u2693\ufe0e In this section you will learn how to get to a running installer for Tumbleweed or Leap . This involves: Using a program to write an installation image -- see Choosing an installation image above -- to an external device, usually a USB pen drive or some other external storage medium. Having the media adequately partioned to host the image, and making it bootable Booting on the external media and run the installer. We will assume that you have downloaded an installation image and optionally, have performed an authenticity check on it -- see the above sections for details. The next section also assumes that you will be using a USB flash drive as the installation media. The section after that handles external hard drives. Prepare the installation media (USB flash drive) \u2693\ufe0e The process for preparing the installation media varies depending on the operating system from which you are following these steps. Different operating systems offer different applications. We recommend using any of the following programs, which we have tested and which are known to be simple to use and reliable on their respective platforms: - Fedora Image Writer ( Windows & Mac , Linux flatpak ) For Fedora Image Writer : Make sure your USB flash drive has enough storage to hold the image (either ~1 GB or ~5 GB) and plug it in. Run Fedora Image Writer . From the main menu pick Custom image and then select the .iso image to write to the USB flash drive. Make sure that both the image and flash drive have been correctly selected, as in: Finally click on Write to Disk . Once writing the image is done, you are ready to reboot from the USB drive. Leaving the USB drive plugged in, use the method appropriate to your operating system to restart your computer. Reboot to the device \u2693\ufe0e Assuming you have successfully installed an openSUSE distribution, you should reboot according to the method relevant to your current operating system. Windows \u2693\ufe0e Use these instructions to reboot to your BIOS or UEFI. From there you will be able to select the USB flash drive hosting the installation image as boot destination. macOS \u2693\ufe0e Simply hold the alt (option) key immediately after restarting and select the openSUSE bootloader from there.","title":"Preparing the installation media"},{"location":"image_choice/#choosing-an-installation-media","text":"The installers and images can be obtained on the Tumbleweed and Leap pages.

Podman is using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images, which means that containers crated with/for Docker or CRI-o will work with Podman as well and vice versa. It is coming with a command-line interface (CLI) which offers pretty much the same commands as Docker does. How similar are Podman commands to Docker? Let's put it this way: many Podman users just alias docker to podman . Like other runtimes, Podman also relies on an OCI compliant container runtime to interface with the operating system. Podamn also has a RESTful API to manage containers, offers automatic updates of containers, and has a fantastic systemd integration. Getting containers running \u2693\ufe0e Rootfull or rootless \u2693\ufe0e As Podman is daemonless, running containers doesn't require running them with root but can be started with a user as well. Granted, rootless containers will have no access to networking and can't use privileged ports, but it is a great way to keep the system secure. For instance, if an application escapes the container ran as a user it will be able to cause less damage and would have limited access to the system than if it would run as root. Rootfull containers are recommended for running applications that require access over privileged ports like a public facing `Nginx reverse proxy. Even in that case, there could be some rules implemented in the firewall that forwards requests, but that's a different story Rootless environment configuration \u2693\ufe0e The next steps will allow for the deployment of a rootless configuration with Podman. Important to note that these changes should apply for other distros as well: 1. Make sure that fuse-overlayfs is installed and it is available in the user $PATH . (In openSUSE fuse-overlayfs is a dependency of Podman therefore when Podman is being installed it will install fuse-overlayfs as well.) # which fuse-overlayfs /usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs 2. Enable user namespaces. On openSUSE this step should not be necessary. Check the number of available namespaces that are allowed in the system in /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces . To set a value or a different value you need to run sysctl user.max_user_namespaces=28633 as root . 3. /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration. This is very important so instead of using my own words I move this out from the official Podman documentation and insert it here (source: rootless tutorial ) Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs listed in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files. The shadow-utils or newuid package provides these files on different distributions and they must be installed on the system. These files will need someone with root privileges on the system to add or update the entries withi n them. The following is a summarization from the How does rootless Podman work? article by Dan Walsh on opensource.com Update the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid with fields for each user that will be allowed to create containers that look like the following. Note that the values for each user must be unique and without any overlap. If there is an overlap, there is a potential for a user to use another\u2019s namespace and they could corrupt it. cat /etc/subuid johndoe:100000:65536 test:165536:65536 The format of this file is USERNAME:UID:RANGE username as listed in /etc/passwd or getpwent. The initial uid allocated for the user. The size of the range of UIDs allocated for the user. This means the user johndoe is allocated UIDS 100000-165535 as well as their standard UID in the /etc/passwd file. NOTE: this is not currently supported with network installs. These files must be available locally to the host machine. It is not possible to configure this with LDAP or Active Directory. If you update either the /etc/subuid or the /etc/subgid file, you need to stop all the running containers owned by the user and kill the pause process that is running on the system for that user. This can be done automatically by using the podman system migrate command which will stop all the containers for the user and will kill the pause process. Rather than updating the files directly, the usermod program can be used to assign UIDs and GIDs to a user. usermod --add-subuids 200000-201000 --add-subgids 200000-201000 johndoe grep johndoe /etc/subuid /etc/subgid /etc/subuid:johndoe:200000:1001 /etc/subgid:johndoe:200000:1001 Here I would also add that you need to be careful with the subuid and subgid allocation as if the same UID / GID values are given to users y as well as for user x then user y will have access to the containers ran by user x . Registries \u2693\ufe0e Podman supports every OCI compliant registries like Dockerhub, Quay.io, Treescale etc. To check, add, and remove the registries the system uses one can simply edit /etc/containers/registries.conf . # For more information on this configuration file, see containers-registries.conf(5). # # Registries to search for images that are not fully-qualified. # i.e. foobar.com/my_image:latest vs my_image:latest [registries.search] registries = [\"registry.opensuse.org\", \"docker.io\"] # Registries that do not use TLS when pulling images or uses self-signed # certificates. [registries.insecure] registries = [] # Blocked Registries, blocks the `docker daemon` from pulling from the blocked registry. If you specify # \"*\", then the docker daemon will only be allowed to pull from registries listed above in the search # registries. Blocked Registries is deprecated because other container runtimes and tools will not use it. # It is recommended that you use the trust policy file /etc/containers/policy.json to control which # registries you want to allow users to pull and push from. policy.json gives greater flexibility, and # supports all container runtimes and tools including the docker daemon, cri-o, buildah ... [registries.block] registries = [] On openSUSE you will have registry.opensuse.org added to your registries out of the box which is the official registry of the openSUSE project. You can add for example quay.io to this list to be able to search, pull, and push from/to Quay. When searching or pulling a container from a registry, Podman will check the registries from /etc/containers/registries.conf listed under [registries.search] block. Podman will check the URI in the order they're added in [registries.search] . Login to registry \u2693\ufe0e Just like with Docker you can log in to a registry with your username and password using podman login [registry] . Once logged in the credentials will be stored in ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json . For the sake of automation you could make a copy of this auth.json file to be used in different scripts for building or deploying containerized applications, but keep the file with your credentials safe. Searching for a container \u2693\ufe0e To search with Podman for an application use: $ podman search nginx INDEX NAME DESCRIPTION STARS OFFICIAL AUTOMATED opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/devel/kubic/containers/container/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dcassany/obs-service/container/kubic-nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dcassany/obs-service/container/kubic/nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dmolkentin/video/containers/opensuse-nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-fpm 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-ssl 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-uwsgi 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/mook_work/scf/nginx-buildpack-release/images/images/nginx-buildpack 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/onielsen/virtualization/kubic-container/15.0/containers/kubic/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/pgeorgiadis/branches/devel/caasp/kubic-container/container/kubic/nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/sjamgade/helm/opensuse_leap_15.2/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/arm/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/powerpc/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/powerpc/totest/images/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/zsystems/images/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/zsystems/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/nginx 0 docker.io docker.io/library/nginx Official build of Nginx. 14378 [OK] docker.io docker.io/jwilder/nginx-proxy Automated Nginx reverse proxy for docker con... 1951 [OK] To search in a specific repository: $ podman search registry.opensuse.org/nginx INDEX NAME DESCRIPTION STARS OFFICIAL AUTOMATED opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/devel/kubic/containers/container/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dcassany/obs-service/container/kubic-nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dcassany/obs-service/container/kubic/nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/dmolkentin/video/containers/opensuse-nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-fpm 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-ssl 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/illuusio/images/images_15.2/opensuse/ilmi/nginx-uwsgi 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/mook_work/scf/nginx-buildpack-release/images/images/nginx-buildpack 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/onielsen/virtualization/kubic-container/15.0/containers/kubic/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/pgeorgiadis/branches/devel/caasp/kubic-container/container/kubic/nginx-ingress-controller 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/home/sjamgade/helm/opensuse_leap_15.2/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/arm/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/powerpc/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/powerpc/totest/images/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/zsystems/images/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/factory/zsystems/totest/containers/opensuse/nginx 0 opensuse.org registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/nginx 0 Pulling a container \u2693\ufe0e To pull a container: $ podman pull nginx Completed short name \"nginx\" with unqualified-search registries (origin: /etc/containers/registries.conf) Trying to pull registry.opensuse.org/nginx:latest... name unknown Trying to pull docker.io/library/nginx:latest...

This will provide a list of every image that is currently available in the system and ready to be used without needing to pull it from a registry. To delete an image use podman rmi . Visit the podman images man page for more. Podman Pods \u2693\ufe0e The pod concept has been introduced in Kubernetes and Docker users usually don't even think of the possibility or benefits to run pods in a local runtime or a development environment. Pods are great if, for example, you need a database (DB) container that you don't want to bind to a routable network. In comes the idea of the pod . Instead of binding the DB to a routable network, you can bind it to localhost therefore other containers within the pod can connect to it using localhost as they share the network namespace. Another use case can be to group containers in pods. Every pod has an 'infra' container that functions as the namespace holder, stores data on port bindings, cgroup-parent values, and kernel namespaces are all assigned to the \u201cinfra\u201d container. Once the pod is created these values can not be changed. The pod can also allow starting, stop, pause multiple containers at once just by doing the same as would with a single container, but instead by container the commands can be executed by pods resulting in the desired effect, but faster and a lot more comfortably. For details on pod related cli commands visit the podman pod man page. Pod creation \u2693\ufe0e You can create the pods by naming them and exposing the required ports. This way we're not required to setup containers individually in terms of publishing ports just adding the containers to them. $ podman pod create -n yaltb -p 8000:8000 7244e77552d9bee402383a37906813b4194cef89c930c87d4d590d92fce827b0 $ podman pod list POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED INFRA ID # OF CONTAINERS 7244e77552d9 yaltb Created 8 seconds ago 4a696258e500 1 A little breakdown here: * -n or --name will allow to set the name of the pod. * -p or --publish will expose the desired port(s) that will be used to access container(s) from outside the host. * podman pod list is listing the available pods with their basic information. For more information visit the podman pod create man page. Adding containers to a pod \u2693\ufe0e Pods can hold as many containers as you want. To add containers just set the --pod flag when creating the container. $ podman run -d --pod yaltb nginx 6645234da2d18f60632fdcfed3a7825a81649c606dfeba70fec11b9d5479174d $ podman pod list POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED INFRA ID # OF CONTAINERS 7244e77552d9 yaltb Running 10 minutes ago 4a696258e500 2 $ podman ps -a --pod CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD ID PODNAME 6645234da2d1 nginx /usr/sbin/nginx 15 seconds ago Up 15 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp clever_williamson 7244e77552d9 yaltb 4a696258e500 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2 10 minutes ago Up 15 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp 7244e77552d9-infra 7244e77552d9 yaltb Breaking it down: * podman run -d --pod yaltb nginx will create and add an nginx container to the previously create yaltb pod. The pod has been defined by the --pod flag followed by the name of the pod. Notice that we didn't expose ports as they are already exposed in the created port. Important: network can't be configured when it is shared with a pod therefore you need to expose/publish ports upon pod creation. * podman ps -a --pod will list every container that is running in pods. Managing containers in pods \u2693\ufe0e Containers in pods can be managed individually regardless they're running within a pod. Do check above for the options for managing containers. This means that if you need to remove a container from a pod Exporting pods \u2693\ufe0e Pods can be exported with podman generate command. This would allow one to take the exported pod and deploy it the same way it is deployed on the local runtime on a different Podman server or even on a Kubernetes cluster. $ podman generate kube yaltb # Generation of Kubernetes YAML is still under development! # # Save the output of this file and use kubectl create -f to import # it into Kubernetes. # # Created with podman-2.2.1 apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: creationTimestamp: \"2021-02-05T05:28:08Z\" labels: app: yaltb name: yaltb spec: containers: - command: - /usr/sbin/nginx env: - name: PATH value: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin - name: TERM value: xterm - name: container value: podman - name: HOSTNAME value: yaltb image: nginx name: condescendinggalois ports: - containerPort: 8000 hostPort: 8000 protocol: TCP resources: {} securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: true capabilities: {} privileged: false readOnlyRootFilesystem: false seLinuxOptions: {} workingDir: / - command: - /usr/sbin/nginx env: - name: PATH value: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin - name: TERM value: xterm - name: container value: podman - name: HOSTNAME value: yaltb image: nginx name: cleverwilliamson resources: {} securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: true capabilities: {} privileged: false readOnlyRootFilesystem: false seLinuxOptions: {} workingDir: / restartPolicy: Never status: {} --- metadata: creationTimestamp: null spec: {} status: loadBalancer: {} $ podman pod stop yaltb 7244e77552d9bee402383a37906813b4194cef89c930c87d4d590d92fce827b0 $ podman pod rm yaltb 7244e77552d9bee402383a37906813b4194cef89c930c87d4d590d92fce827b0 $ podman play kube yaltb_pod.yml Pod: ce21bc0689409795800d7e0f699f4503b6be8f7f81bcc4fabc33e5da32bba164 Containers: 13e9f16b1aaaa7be1f19c87c21d99deaca3862d97293b98c20bf792d72738911 c5f8e4364b0e0caca047b3797ffc0aaf268460aee9249efc4d46259c4693eddd [~] podman pod ps POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED INFRA ID # OF CONTAINERS ce21bc068940 yaltb Degraded 11 seconds ago c78bebfb3cc3 3 [~] podman ps -a --pod CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD ID PODNAME 13e9f16b1aaa nginx /usr/sbin/nginx 19 seconds ago Up 19 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp yaltb-condescendinggalois ce21bc068940 yaltb c5f8e4364b0e nginx /usr/sbin/nginx 19 seconds ago Exited (1) 16 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp yaltb-cleverwilliamson ce21bc068940 yaltb c78bebfb3cc3 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2 19 seconds ago Up 19 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp ce21bc068940-infra ce21bc068940 yaltb [~] podman ps --pod CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD ID PODNAME 13e9f16b1aaa nginx /usr/sbin/nginx 30 seconds ago Up 30 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp yaltb-condescendinggalois ce21bc068940 yaltb c78bebfb3cc3 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2 30 seconds ago Up 30 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp ce21bc068940-infra ce21bc068940 yaltb Lets break down the above: * podman generate kube yaltb will generated a YAML file which one can take to another server and play it providing the same exact pod that it is running on the local runtime. * podman pod stop yaltb will stop the yaltb pod and all the containers in it. * podman pod rm yaltb will delete the yaltb pod. * podman play kube yaltb_pod.yml will start the exported pods based on the YAML file. The pod and the containers in the pod listed in the following commands. Podman and systemd \u2693\ufe0e Podman has fantastic integration with systemd . Users are even able to run systemd within a container which makes perfect sense. Why would we have to use anything different inside a container than we already got used to outside of a container? Anyhow, we are not covering this, but managing containers with systemd . As we deploy more and more containers managing them using the Podman cli tool only may quickly become burdensome. It is much easier to manage the pods and containers with systemd for example to restart, stop, or to start them. Using systemd will also enable us to utilize podman auto-update for updating the containers. Generating a systemd unit \u2693\ufe0e Podman has the ability to generate the unit files for us which is probably a relief as it makes life incredibly comfortable. Criteria is that it outputs the generated units into a file using the container's name or ID. In this example I will go for the ID which I will cover why in the Podman auto-update section. $ podman generate systemd --files --new admiring_franklin /home/yaltb/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service $ cat container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service # container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service # autogenerated by Podman 2.2.1 # Fri Feb 5 12:52:43 WIB 2021 [Unit] Description=Podman container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.service Documentation=man:podman-generate-systemd(1) Wants=network.target After=network-online.target [Service] Environment=PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=%n Restart=on-failure ExecStartPre=/bin/rm -f %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.pid %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.ctr-id ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --conmon-pidfile %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.pid --cidfile %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.ctr-id --cgroups=no-conmon -d -p 8000:8000 nginx ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop --ignore --cidfile %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.ctr-id -t 10 ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/podman rm --ignore -f --cidfile %t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.ctr-id PIDFile=%t/container-aaef566e500973a2d4e9df22208e4a74ae5ea961083adbbe6bb6e98fbb19f7e7.pid KillMode=none Type=forking [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target default.target Breaking all that down: * podman generate systemd which will generate systemd units * --files which will output the generated unit to a file as container-[$CONTAINERNAME] * --new admiring_franklin will allow systemd` to create and run updated images followed by the container's name.

covers everything that container is running with. Labels, mounts, volumes, exposed ports etc. Extremely useful for debugging and of course the output can be filtered. For more visit the podman inspect man page. The next useful tool to check what is happening real-time inside a container is podman logs which will output the stdout of the container. This can cover errors, warnings or general output information from the application inside the container. $ podman logs admiring_franklin [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.909589 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module actions_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_actions.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.928259 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module alias_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_alias.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.937031 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module auth_basic_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_auth_basic.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.938069 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authn_core_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authn_core.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.946344 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authn_file_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authn_file.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.956344 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authz_host_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authz_host.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.974215 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authz_groupfile_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authz_groupfile.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.990336 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authz_core_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authz_core.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.991396 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module authz_user_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_authz_user.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.992640 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module autoindex_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_autoindex.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.995014 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module cgi_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_cgi.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:48.996348 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module dir_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_dir.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.003103 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module env_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_env.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.003674 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module expires_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_expires.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.004606 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module include_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_include.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.005130 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module log_config_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_log_config.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.018137 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module mime_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_mime.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.028327 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module negotiation_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_negotiation.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.036869 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module setenvif_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_setenvif.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.078484 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module ssl_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_ssl.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.081221 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module socache_shmcb_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_socache_shmcb.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.081547 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module userdir_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_userdir.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.082180 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module reqtimeout_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_reqtimeout.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.084216 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module rewrite_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_rewrite.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.089975 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module headers_module from /usr/lib64/apache2-prefork/mod_headers.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.135714 2021] [so:debug] [pid 10] mod_so.c(266): AH01575: loaded module php7_module from /usr/lib64/apache2/mod_php7.so [Thu Feb 04 20:30:49.430178 2021] [core:info] [pid 10] AH00545: MaxRequestsPerChild is deprecated, use MaxConnectionsPerChild instead.

Volumes \u2693\ufe0e Volumes, unlike bind mounts are managed by Podman and this is the preferred way of having a persistent storage space attached to a container.

Upon the creation of the volume if a name is not set a random one will be generated * This is being followed by a proof-of-concept in which I created a container, mounted the volume, wrote a file and stored it in the volume then destroyed the container. Recreated it with the same command and volume and read out the files previously created inside the already destroyed container. For more visit the podman volume man page. Updating containers \u2693\ufe0e Can go about this a few different ways like pulling a container, launching it, mounting the necessary shares and config files and starting it on a different exposed port than the one we're planning to \"update\". Once this is done, tested and works fine can just change the route to point to this updated container. Me being a lazy DevOps engineer I don't like this option so let's visit podman auto-update . Podman auto-update \u2693\ufe0e Before we go any further there are few things to make sure are set correctly on our container: * there is no --restart=always flag present, * the container is managed by systemd , * the systemd unit has been generated by the container's ID not by it's name, * the systemd unit has been generated with the --new flag. Podman's other important feature is the automatic updates of containers without the need of even putting containers in pods or adding a Watchtower service. This is done by adding the --label io.containers.autoupdate=image label during container creation. This to be followed by generating systemd units for the container: podman generate systemd --new --files [container ID or name] . Once this is ready and the unit file is under the corresponding systemd folder - depending on how podman is used, rootfull or rootless - the container unit to be started. Following this the podman auto-update command can update every container with changed images. References \u2693\ufe0e I strongly suggest checking out the man pages of podman which provides a lot of information straight from the terminal. Also the following resources can help a lot on your podman journey: * https://podman.io/ * http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/ * http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Tutorials.html","title":"Setting up a containerized environment"},{"location":"install_podman/#what-is-podman","text":"Podman is a daemon-less, open-source tool to manage, deploy and build application containers. Podman is using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images, which means that containers crated with/for Docker or CRI-o will work with Podman as well and vice versa. It is coming with a command-line interface (CLI) which offers pretty much the same commands as Docker does. How similar are Podman commands to Docker? Let's put it this way: many Podman users just alias docker to podman . Like other runtimes, Podman also relies on an OCI compliant container runtime to interface with the operating system. Podamn also has a RESTful API to manage containers, offers automatic updates of containers, and has a fantastic systemd integration.","title":"What is Podman"},{"location":"install_podman/#getting-containers-running","text":"","title":"Getting containers running"},{"location":"install_podman/#rootfull-or-rootless","text":"As Podman is daemonless, running containers doesn't require running them with root but can be started with a user as well. Granted, rootless containers will have no access to networking and can't use privileged ports, but it is a great way to keep the system secure. For instance, if an application escapes the container ran as a user it will be able to cause less damage and would have limited access to the system than if it would run as root. Rootfull containers are recommended for running applications that require access over privileged ports like a public facing `Nginx reverse proxy. Even in that case, there could be some rules implemented in the firewall that forwards requests, but that's a different story","title":"Rootfull or rootless"},{"location":"install_podman/#rootless-environment-configuration","text":"The next steps will allow for the deployment of a rootless configuration with Podman. Important to note that these changes should apply for other distros as well: 1. Make sure that fuse-overlayfs is installed and it is available in the user $PATH . (In openSUSE fuse-overlayfs is a dependency of Podman therefore when Podman is being installed it will install fuse-overlayfs as well.) # which fuse-overlayfs /usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs 2. Enable user namespaces. On openSUSE this step should not be necessary. Check the number of available namespaces that are allowed in the system in /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces . To set a value or a different value you need to run sysctl user.max_user_namespaces=28633 as root . 3. /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration. This is very important so instead of using my own words I move this out from the official Podman documentation and insert it here (source: rootless tutorial ) Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs listed in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files. The shadow-utils or newuid package provides these files on different distributions and they must be installed on the system. These files will need someone with root privileges on the system to add or update the entries withi n them. The following is a summarization from the How does rootless Podman work? article by Dan Walsh on opensource.com Update the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid with fields for each user that will be allowed to create containers that look like the following. Note that the values for each user must be unique and without any overlap. If there is an overlap, there is a potential for a user to use another\u2019s namespace and they could corrupt it. cat /etc/subuid johndoe:100000:65536 test:165536:65536 The format of this file is USERNAME:UID:RANGE username as listed in /etc/passwd or getpwent. The initial uid allocated for the user. The size of the range of UIDs allocated for the user. This means the user johndoe is allocated UIDS 100000-165535 as well as their standard UID in the /etc/passwd file. NOTE: this is not currently supported with network installs. These files must be available locally to the host machine. It is not possible to configure this with LDAP or Active Directory. If you update either the /etc/subuid or the /etc/subgid file, you need to stop all the running containers owned by the user and kill the pause process that is running on the system for that user. This can be done automatically by using the podman system migrate command which will stop all the containers for the user and will kill the pause process. Rather than updating the files directly, the usermod program can be used to assign UIDs and GIDs to a user. usermod --add-subuids 200000-201000 --add-subgids 200000-201000 johndoe grep johndoe /etc/subuid /etc/subgid /etc/subuid:johndoe:200000:1001 /etc/subgid:johndoe:200000:1001 Here I would also add that you need to be careful with the subuid and subgid allocation as if the same UID / GID values are given to users y as well as for user x then user y will have access to the containers ran by user x .","title":"Rootless environment configuration"},{"location":"install_podman/#registries","text":"Podman supports every OCI compliant registries like Dockerhub, Quay.io, Treescale etc. To check, add, and remove the registries the system uses one can simply edit /etc/containers/registries.conf . # For more information on this configuration file, see containers-registries.conf(5). # # Registries to search for images that are not fully-qualified. # i.e. foobar.com/my_image:latest vs my_image:latest [registries.search] registries = [\"registry.opensuse.org\", \"docker.io\"] # Registries that do not use TLS when pulling images or uses self-signed # certificates.

Instead of binding the DB to a routable network, you can bind it to localhost therefore other containers within the pod can connect to it using localhost as they share the network namespace. Another use case can be to group containers in pods. Every pod has an 'infra' container that functions as the namespace holder, stores data on port bindings, cgroup-parent values, and kernel namespaces are all assigned to the \u201cinfra\u201d container. Once the pod is created these values can not be changed.

In System Settings click Shortcuts under the \"Workspace\" category. You will be able to find any pre-existing shortcuts for many KDE applications as well as create your own shortcuts for any applications you install yourself. The Custom Shortcuts menu allows you to create shortcuts for almost any system task. The Shortcuts window has three main areas. The shortcut categories, Shortcuts and Custom Shortcuts . List of applications or custom shortcuts. Shortcut editing area. Many KDE applications are already in the list. If you want to add additional applications simply click Add Application and make a selection from the list. Click OK to confirm the selection. Once this step is done, the new application will be displayed in the Applications column. Changing Keyboard Shortcuts \u2693\ufe0e Select the application you want to change the shortcut for from the Applications column. The list of shortcut actions will be displayed in the editing area on the right. Click on any shortcut action to expand its settings (if there is only one shortcut available it will be automatically expanded). Shortcut actions can have default and custom keyboard shortcuts. You can disable the default by un-marking the box next to it or leave it active alongside any custom shortcuts you choose. Click Add custom shortcut , the button will change to indicate it is waiting for the next key combination, whatever keys are pressed next will be recorded as the custom shortcut. Click the \"cancel\" button, which has now appeared, if you change your mind. When a custom shortcut is recorded, you have the option to delete it by clicking the \"trash\" icon or additional custom shortcuts can be added. Once you are satisfied with the changes, click Apply in the bottom right corner of the shortcuts window. Adding Custom Shortcuts \u2693\ufe0e Select the Custom Shortcuts category from the left hand column of the Shortcuts settings window. Custom shortcuts allow you to trigger your own events from simple to complex that would not normally be available. For demonstration purposes we are going to setup a keyboard shortcut for a program called Rofi . You may not want to use this program yourself but the process is the same for other programs. First we will add a new Custom Shortcut by clicking Edit --> New --> Global Shortcut --> Command/URL . A new entry will be added to the list in the middle column. The entry will be highlighted and its name selected so you can rename it immediately just by typing. If you want to change the name later on, simply double-click the name in the list and start typing. Using a name that is descriptive will help us remember what this custom shortcut does. In this case, the program Rofi will display a list of open applications and switch between their windows with the keyboard. Now add the command that will be run when the keyboard shortcut is pressed. When an action is selected from the middle column, the right hand area will change to the editing view. You will see tabs near the top for Comment , Trigger , and Action . Click the Action tab and add the command to the text box labeled \"Command/URL\". Next click the Trigger tab. This is where the keyboard shortcut that triggers the command will be set. Click the button labeled \"Shortcut\" which will display the current keyboard shortcut if there is one. The button changes color and waits for you to type the desired shortcut. If this keyboard shortcut is already used, a warning will be displayed. Click \"Cancel\" to try a different shortcut or click \"Reassign\" if you wish to use it anyway. For this demonstration, \"Reassign\" is selected. Click Apply at the bottom right of the window. Now the custom keyboard shortcut runs the command system wide, no matter what applications are open.

You will be able to find any pre-existing shortcuts for many KDE applications as well as create your own shortcuts for any applications you install yourself. The Custom Shortcuts menu allows you to create shortcuts for almost any system task. The Shortcuts window has three main areas. The shortcut categories, Shortcuts and Custom Shortcuts . List of applications or custom shortcuts. Shortcut editing area. Many KDE applications are already in the list. If you want to add additional applications simply click Add Application and make a selection from the list. Click OK to confirm the selection. Once this step is done, the new application will be displayed in the Applications column.","title":"Settings &amp; Keybindings"},{"location":"kde/#changing-keyboard-shortcuts","text":"Select the application you want to change the shortcut for from the Applications column. The list of shortcut actions will be displayed in the editing area on the right. Click on any shortcut action to expand its settings (if there is only one shortcut available it will be automatically expanded). Shortcut actions can have default and custom keyboard shortcuts. You can disable the default by un-marking the box next to it or leave it active alongside any custom shortcuts you choose. Click Add custom shortcut , the button will change to indicate it is waiting for the next key combination, whatever keys are pressed next will be recorded as the custom shortcut. Click the \"cancel\" button, which has now appeared, if you change your mind. When a custom shortcut is recorded, you have the option to delete it by clicking the \"trash\" icon or additional custom shortcuts can be added.

Custom shortcuts allow you to trigger your own events from simple to complex that would not normally be available. For demonstration purposes we are going to setup a keyboard shortcut for a program called Rofi . You may not want to use this program yourself but the process is the same for other programs. First we will add a new Custom Shortcut by clicking Edit --> New --> Global Shortcut --> Command/URL . A new entry will be added to the list in the middle column. The entry will be highlighted and its name selected so you can rename it immediately just by typing. If you want to change the name later on, simply double-click the name in the list and start typing. Using a name that is descriptive will help us remember what this custom shortcut does. In this case, the program Rofi will display a list of open applications and switch between their windows with the keyboard. Now add the command that will be run when the keyboard shortcut is pressed. When an action is selected from the middle column, the right hand area will change to the editing view. You will see tabs near the top for Comment , Trigger , and Action . Click the Action tab and add the command to the text box labeled \"Command/URL\". Next click the Trigger tab. This is where the keyboard shortcut that triggers the command will be set. Click the button labeled \"Shortcut\" which will display the current keyboard shortcut if there is one. The button changes color and waits for you to type the desired shortcut. If this keyboard shortcut is already used, a warning will be displayed. Click \"Cancel\" to try a different shortcut or click \"Reassign\" if you wish to use it anyway. For this demonstration, \"Reassign\" is selected. Click Apply at the bottom right of the window.

Info Those components are called packages , because they \"pack\" the programs and resources making up most of your system, along with tools to install them). \"Upgrading\" means \"Upgrading packages\" (such as those that constitute your Linux distribution). Even though Tumbleweed uses a rolling-release model, it is very stable: openSUSE thoroughly tests every package before going into an update, ensuring the stability of your system. Moreover you can always revert back to the previous state of Tumbleweed (in jargon: \"switch to the previous snapshot\". Snapshots are explained here ). What you have to bear in mind, however, is that Tumbleweed requires a reliable internet connection and a healthy hard drive to work as designed. It also requires that you sometimes take interest in the updating process. Leap \u2693\ufe0e Leap is a more traditional distribution: it uses a fixed-points release model, just like Windows, Ubuntu, or macOS. Leap is a very battle-hardened operating system, mostly made up of packages brought over from SUSE Linux Enterprise, a commercial Linux operating system for servers, and of packages from Tumbleweed after they were tested, tried and used by the community. It is worth noting that Leap provides a Linux kernel that is several years behind the version offered by Tumbleweed. Info The kernel is the heart of any Linux operating system. It translates your keystrokes and mouse clicks into the ones and zeros the computer understands, and is updated regularly so that the computer can respond to new hardware added to the system. This means that you might be better served by Tumbleweed if you have a recent computer or rely extensively on \"exotic\" hardware. Our recommendation \u2693\ufe0e Pick Tumbleweed if you intend to use your machine as a desktop machine unless: You have a very limited bandwidth or an unreliable access to the Internet. You have an old (7+ years old mechanical hard drive that will struggle with frequent, numerous updates. You cannot afford to reboot your computer frequently to install updates. You don't want to use, or switch between, different snapshots. Your rely on specific versions of important packages, including hardware drivers, and generally speaking you don't want or cannot take advantage of recent packages, including recent kernels. You would rather not do package management manually and more generally, you would rather avoid using the command line. The more conditions apply to your use case, the stronger we recommend you to install Leap instead of Tumbleweed. Info It is not recommended for new users, however, it is possible to use microOS on a desktop computer, taking advantage of transactional updates. This might appeal to advanced users who want to provide friends or relatives with an operating system that will require little to no maintenance. You might be interested in the microOs documentation for more about this use case. Desktop Environments \u2693\ufe0e Leap offers the GNOME and KDE Plasma desktop environments by default. Tumbleweed offers GNOME , KDE Plasma , and XFCE . These options are chosen during the System Role section of the installation. Additional options are available in the Software selection of the installer. These desktop environment patterns may also be viewed and modified with the YaST Software Management module. Modern desktop environments have evolved into highly consistent and productive computing experiences. Choosing the right desktop environment for you can be a deeply personal experience; many people feel as passionately about their desktop environment as they do their distribution. One of the distinguishing options of openSUSE, during the installation, is the ability to choose a desktop environment. This provides a certain level of assurance that you will have a well-supported desktop experience for that desktop environment, no derivatives or spin-offs needed. Installation \u2693\ufe0e During openSUSE Installation , there is a section titled System Role , which applies patterns to the software selected for the respective installation. This is the primary means to select a desktop environment. There is an additional option titled Generic Desktop . If you wish to install a desktop environment available in the installer, but not in the System Role , you can select Generic Desktop and customize the Software selection later within the installer. The descriptions below are as provided by the respective projects. GNOME \u2693\ufe0e GNOME 3 has been designed from the ground up to help you have the best possible computing experience. GNOME 3 provides a focused working environment that helps you to get things done, and it is packed with features that will make you more productive. A powerful search feature lets you access all your work from one place. Side-by-side windows makes it easy to view several documents at the same time, and we even provide a way to turn off notifications when you really need to concentrate on the task in hand. GNOME.org Install Gnome Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with GNOME KDE Plasma \u2693\ufe0e Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right as you need them and when you need them. With Plasma the user is king. Not happy with the color scheme? Change it! Want to have your panel on the left edge of the screen? Move it! Don't like the font? Use a different one! Download custom widgets in one click and add them to your desktop or panel. KDE.org Install KDE Plasma Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with KDE Plasma XFCE \u2693\ufe0e XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly. XFCE embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment. Another priority of XFCE is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org .

Generic Desktop \u2693\ufe0e Another option for a System Role is the Generic Desktop environment. This option enables IceWM , but also allows selection of one of the optional desktop environments later, during the Software selection of the installation. If you intend to choose one of the other desktop environments, choose Yes , when asked \"Activate online repositories now?\" and ensure Main Repository (OSS) is enabled on the Online Repositories step. IceWM \u2693\ufe0e IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user\u2019s way. It comes with a taskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu system. Application windows can be managed by the keyboard and mouse. Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be hidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list. Ice-WM.org Install IceWM Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Additional Choices \u2693\ufe0e Before confirming the installation, an overview is provided with the selected installation options, titled Installer Settings . At this point, you can modify the Software selected to be installed. In addition to reducing or adding packages, you can also select other desktop environments to install. If you prefer one of these desktop environments, de-select the A very basic desktop pattern, then select one of the below patterns: Enlightenment \u2693\ufe0e Enlightenment is classified as a \"desktop shell\" as it provides everything you need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite. This covers functionality including launching applications, managing their windows and performing system tasks like suspending, rebooting, managing files and so on. Enlightenment.org Install Enlightment Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Installer > Installer Settings : Select Software Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks : De-Select A very basic desktop Select Enlightenment Note Clicking the Details... button on Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks displays packages associated with the respective patterns. LXDE \u2693\ufe0e LXDE, which stands for Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast. It is designed to be user friendly and slim, while keeping the resource usage low. LXDE uses less RAM and less CPU while being a feature rich desktop environment. Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies. This makes porting LXDE to different distributions and platforms easier. LXDE.org Install LXDE Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Installer > Installer Settings : Select Software Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks : De-Select A very basic desktop Select LXDE Desktop Environment Note Clicking the Details... button on Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks displays packages associated with the respective patterns. LXQt \u2693\ufe0e LXQt is a Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment. It will not get in your way. It will not hang or slow down your system. It is focused on being a classic desktop with a modern look and feel. Historically, LXQt is the product of the merge between LXDE-Qt, an initial Qt flavour of LXDE, and Razor-qt, a project aiming to develop a Qt based desktop environment with similar objectives as the current LXQt.

MATE \u2693\ufe0e The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies while preserving a traditional desktop experience. Mate-Desktop.org Install MATE Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Installer > Installer Settings : Select Software Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks : De-Select A very basic desktop Select MATE Desktop Environment Note Clicking the Details... button on Installer > Software Selection and System Tasks displays packages associated with the respective patterns. Sway \u2693\ufe0e Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which maximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated using only the keyboard.

Snapshots are fully defined state in your system at one point in time, just like a photography is a fully defined moment in a movie, for example. Snapper is able to create, delete and compare snapshots, and to undo changes that occurred between snapshots. It is thus a powerful maintenance tool that allows you to 'cheat' the flow of time: if you run into an outstanding bug you can use Snapper to rollback to a past snapshot, typically one where the bug didn't exist yet. Or if you've already moved to a past snapshot, you are able to switch move to a snapshot that lies in the 'future' relative to it. Snapper has both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical Interface . Not all functionality is available through the graphical interface but inexperienced users should find it sufficient for basic tasks. Snapper is deeply integrated with the Btrfs filesystem, serving as an easy to use helper for the built in functions of Btrfs. The most common Btrfs tasks can be conducted with Snapper, however, there may be instances when it is necessary to interact with Btrfs directly. Tumbleweed users should note that understanding how to use Snapper is an important step in maintaining a stable, functional system. As a rolling release, Tumbleweed, is subjected to less testing overall and the occasional system breaking update can be installed. Such problems are quickly and easily resolved with Snapper. Info Even though Snapper is key to a healthy Tumbleweed experience, it also benefits Leap as it allows you to quickly recover from breakages occuring before login, typically involving the GRUB bootloader or the loading of the kernel with unhealthy parameter values. Snapper capabilities \u2693\ufe0e Undo system changes made by zypper and YaST. Restore files from previous snapshots. Do a system rollback by booting from a snapshot. Manually create and manage snapshots, within the running system. Defaults \u2693\ufe0e By default, openSUSE Tumbleweed formats your hard drive with the Btrfs filesystem which provides the powerful snapshot capabilities. Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root partition / . The default snapshot configuration should only be changed by experienced users but it is important to note some default behaviour for new users as well. Snapshots are automatically enabled for the root / partition if it is larger than 16 Gigabytes. This is to ensure there is enough disk space for the snapshots and important system tasks to occur, which may include moving, writing or deleting files. If the root / partition is smaller than 16 Gigabytes a different kind of snapshot is used, known as \"Timeline Snapshots\". These snapshots are created every hour. By default only the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. This ensures there are some snapshots for system rollbacks while taking up very minimal disk space. The users /home directory is not included in snapshots and should not be relied on as a data backup for personal files. This prevents data loss if a system rollback is conducted. Changes to personal files would also be \"undone\". Directories /opt and /usr/local , where various software and third-party products are installed are not included in snapshots by default. This prevents uninstalling the software if a system rollback is conducted. Snapshot Types \u2693\ufe0e snapper features 3 types of snapshots: Timeline , Installation , and Administration . Timeline snapshots are single snapshots, created every hour and old snapshots are automatically deleted. By default, the first snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. Disabled by default on partitions larger than 16 Gigabytes. The only single snapshots present may be the ones created when openSUSE was installed. Installation snapshots are created in pairs ( Pre and Post ) when packages are installed with YaST or Zypper. Snapshot pairs are marked as important if an important system component, such as the kernel, has been installed. Enabled by default. Administration snapshots are created in pairs ( Pre and Post ) when system administration is performed using YaST. The Pre snapshot is created when a YaST module is started and the Post snapshot is created when the module is closed. Enabled by default. Note By default, the last ten important and the last ten regular snapshot pairs are kept. This total encompasses both Installation and Administration snapshot types. Snapshots are automatically deleted when they take up too much space on the disk, but four important and two regular snapshots are always kept. Configuring Snapper \u2693\ufe0e By default Snapper is configured for access with sudo privileges (typically root ). This is because under the hood Snapper works hand-in-hand with the Btrfs file system, which is set up for root . Thus in this section we will assume that you will use Snapper accordingly. To get started you can display all current configurations: $ sudo snapper list-configs That would typically return: Configuration | Subvolume --------------+------------ root | / To show this configuration, we is by default the current user's configuration: $ sudo snapper -c root get-config returning for example: -----------------------+------- ALLOW_GROUPS | ALLOW_USERS | BACKGROUND_COMPARISON | yes EMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP | yes EMPTY_PRE_POST_MIN_AGE | 1800 FREE_LIMIT | 0.2 FSTYPE | btrfs NUMBER_CLEANUP | yes NUMBER_LIMIT | 4 NUMBER_LIMIT_HOURLY | 3 NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT | 2 NUMBER_MIN_AGE | 1800 QGROUP | 1/0 SPACE_LIMIT | 0.2 SUBVOLUME | / SYNC_ACL | no TIMELINE_CLEANUP | yes TIMELINE_CREATE | no TIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY | 10 TIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY | 0 TIMELINE_LIMIT_YEARLY | 10 TIMELINE_MIN_AGE | 1800 Notice the snapshot types discussed in the previous section, but don't take this for reference (you will want superior values for the NUMBER_LIMITS options). To change a value, do $ sudo snapper -c root set-config \"{option name}={new value}\" as in: $ sudo snapper -c root set-config \"NUMBER_LIMIT=4\" You can create configuration profiles for various purposes. To create a new profile, do $ sudo snapper -c <subvolume> create-config <subvolume id> as in: $ sudo snapper -c foo create-config /foo You can later remove any config with: $ sudo snapper -c <subvolume> delete-config <subvolume id> as in: $ sudo snapper -c foo delete-config /foot Creating and Deleting Snapshots \u2693\ufe0e You can create snapshots at any time. For example, to create a new snapshot for root (the default consumer of snapshots on openSUSE distributions): $ sudo snapper -c root create -d \"<description>\" or more tersely: $ sudo snapper create -d \"<description>\" Info Notice the \" \" surrounding the placeholder. It's a good practice to wrap text strings in this way, so as to make it easier to discern them from other types of values. It's advisable to use a meaningful description to make it easier to recognize your manually created snapshots later. To remove a snapshot, regardless of whether it was automatically or manually created, do: $ sudo snapper -c / delete <snapshot id> or the terser $ sudo snapper delete <snapshot id> Rolling back \u2693\ufe0e Identifying Snapshots \u2693\ufe0e There are two ways to identify which snapshot you may want to rollback to: * with the snapper command line utility * with the YaST utility at YaST > Filesystem Snapshots Snapper command line: $ sudo snapper list Snapper CLI Example $ sudo snapper list [sudo] password for root: # | Type | Pre # | Date | User | Cleanup | Description | UserData ----+--------+-------+---------------------------------+------+---------+-----------------------+-------------- 0 | single | | | root | | current | 1* | single | | Thu 17 Dec 2020 10:59:10 PM MST | root | | first root filesystem | 2 | single | | Fri 18 Dec 2020 12:02:05 AM MST | root | number | after installation | important=yes 39 | pre | | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:58:34 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 40 | post | 39 | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:58:54 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 41 | pre | | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:59:02 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 42 | post | 41 | Sat 19 Dec 2020 01:59:59 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 43 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:30:27 PM MST | root | number | yast firewall | 44 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:17 PM MST | root | number | yast firewall | 45 | post | 43 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:17 PM MST | root | number | | 46 | post | 44 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:31:38 PM MST | root | number | | 47 | pre | | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:36:25 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=no 48 | post | 47 | Sun 20 Dec 2020 05:37:00 PM MST | root | number | | important=no 49 | pre | | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:40:20 PM MST | root | number | yast snapper | 50 | pre | | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:42:33 PM MST | root | number | zypp(zypper) | important=yes 51 | post | 50 | Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:46:28 PM MST | root | number | | important=yes Snapper YaST interface example Note As snapshots are viewed, snapper will create more snapshots, because administrative tasks are being performed. Moving forward with the assumption there was an issue with the last zypper update, #47 is chosen as the snapshot to recover. Initiating a rollback \u2693\ufe0e Upon identification of a recovery snapshot, reboot openSUSE. At the boot menu, scroll down to, and select, Start bootloader from a read-only snapshot . On the Read-only Snapshot menu, scroll down to, and select, the desired recovery snapshot. Snapshot #47 is used here as an example. openSUSE will appear to boot as normal. Tip There isn't a scroll indicator on the Read-only Snapshot Menu, but it is possible to scroll down to select more options, if available. Confirming a rollback \u2693\ufe0e Once your system has booted, make sure you're satisfied with the current state of your system. Run some tests. Make sure any outstanding bug is not or no longer present. Then if you're satisfied, perform the rollback: $ sudo snapper rollback Your system should then be rebooted and the recovered snapshot will be the new default boot option. In rare cases rolling back with fail as snapper is not able to find the default sub-volume (this may happen if snapper's configuration and the state of your system have diverged in a problematic way, typically if you've made a mistake by accident). To perform a rollack nonetheless you can use the following command: $ sudo snapper --ambit classic rollback <id> replacing <id> with the id of the snapshot you wish to roll back to. Disk Space Management \u2693\ufe0e Snapshots don't occupy much space but certain configurations might still want to remove uneeded snapshots to preventing running out of disk space. Start with a simple list: $ sudo snapper list The list features a column mentioning an estimate of the space occupied by each snapshot. You can remove unneeded snapshots with $ sudo snapper delete <snapshot id> You will find the value of <snapshot id> in the first column ('#'). Subvolumes Health Check \u2693\ufe0e For illustration here is a healthy structure of subvolumes obtained with $ sudo btrfs subvolume list -p / ID 256 gen 70064 parent 5 top level 5 path @ ID 257 gen 198577 parent 256 top level 256 path @/var ID 258 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/usr/local ID 259 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/srv ID 260 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/root ID 261 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/opt ID 262 gen 198577 parent 256 top level 256 path @/home ID 263 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi ID 264 gen 198574 parent 256 top level 256 path @/boot/grub2/i386-pc ID 265 gen 198573 parent 256 top level 256 path @/.snapshots ID 1034 gen 198573 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/224/snapshot ID 1141 gen 195869 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/325/snapshot ID 1142 gen 195876 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/326/snapshot ID 1143 gen 196235 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/327/snapshot ID 1144 gen 196320 parent 265 top level 265 path @/.snapshots/328/snapshot Notice how all snapshots are immediately nested under @/.snapshots/<snapshot id> . If your structure does not match this, you should probably sanitize it. Generally unhealthy structures have the shape: @/.snapshots/<snapshot id>/<garbage> where <garbage> is anything else than just snapshot . If you happen to be in this situation consider removing all badly nested snapshots with: $ sudo btrfs subvolume delete -i <snapshot id> <path> as in for example: sudo btrfs subvolume delete -i 1031 /.snapshots/171/snapshot/.snapshots/420/snapshot/.snapshots/1/snapshot . You might also want to make sure the /.snapshots entry point is correctly registered against fstab : $ cat /etc/fstab UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /.snapshots btrfs subvol=/@/.snapshots 0 0 If this is not the case edit the fstab file accordingly: $ sudo nano /etc/fstab pasting on a new line UUID={your UUID} /.snapshots btrfs subvol=/@/.snapshots 0 0 where the value of your UUID can be determined simply by copying from neighbour lines in the file. Look in particular for lines meeting in the pattern: UID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /var btrfs subvol=/@/var 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /usr/local btrfs subvol=/@/usr/local 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /srv btrfs subvol=/@/srv 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /root btrfs subvol=/@/root 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /opt btrfs subvol=/@/opt 0 0 UUID=22e658f2-1586-4ac2-8aeb-a6862c8c9a25 /home btrfs subvol=/@/home 0 0 Further reading \u2693\ufe0e Snapper.io openSUSE Wiki Portal:Snapper","title":"Snapper and Btrfs"},{"location":"snapper/#snapper","text":"Snapper is a tool for filesystem snapshot management.

Tumbleweed \u2693\ufe0e Introduction \u2693\ufe0e Tumbleweed is a rolling-release distribution. This means it gets updates on a continuous basis, usually several times a week. However, to bring some order and make it easier to manage producing and consuming updates, Tumbleweed fetches updates in batches. A single batch of updates is called a snapshot . Info Tumbleweed snapshots ought not to be confused with Btrfs snapshots , a completely different kind of snapshots. The latter make up the different filesystem states that allow Btrfs users, using tools like YaST2 and snapper , to control which state they want to actualize). Tumbleweed snapshots are thus batches of updates which are tested in openQA -- openSUSE's very best testing pipeline. The tests are thorough and check not only that each upgraded package is healthy, but also that all updates in the same snapshot play nice with one another. A snapshot is thus as healthy as the individual updates it holds, and as the compatibility between one another. It should be emphasized that by default, Tumbleweed updates across all available updates, whether or not they belong to the same snapshots. In other words, the distribution of updates into snapshots is, by default, only used for production purposes. To take advantage of it at the user level, consider the tumbleweed-cli section below . Updating and upgrading \u2693\ufe0e As for Leap updating Tumbleweed is done with sudo zypper dup What this command does is to check whether all repositories registered against the system provide packages with available updates, collect and return the results. Upon confirmation from the user ( y in a terminal window) it will download and then install them. Info On Tumbleweed you will never have to use zypper-up , which is how you would update packages on Leap. The reason is that since Tumbleweed is a rolling-release distribution, updating it means not just updating an arbitrary collection of packages; it also means using the updated packages as the new snapshot which Tumbleweed is to realize. In addition to this zypper-dup enjoys some extra power over zypper-up , being able to not only edit packages, but to remove them when they are no longer required. It may occur that some repositories, when registered against the system, have not been configured to automatically look for new available updates during a zypper-dup . For this reason it might be useful to accompany this command with another one forcing all repositories to check for new updates, resulting in the pair: sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper dup That said, you can ensure that all repositories have been properly configured by listing them and, where applicable, by enabling their autorefresh feature. From the list of repositories obtained from: zypper lr identify repositories whose autorefresh value you want to tweak. For example: # | Alias | Name | Enab-> | GPG Check | Refresh ---+----------------------------------+---------------------+--------+-------------+------------- 2 | brave-browser-beta | brave-browser-beta | Yes | (r ) Yes | No shows that our brave-browser-beta repository has its refresh feature disabled. We can now set it to enabled with: sudo zypper mr -f 2 which is a compact instance of sudo zypper modifyrepo --refresh <repo identifier> tumbleweed-cli \u2693\ufe0e Warning tumbleweed-cli is an experimental tool that comes with a couple of safety issues: the evaluation algorithm used to collect statistics about the 'health condition' of available Tumbleweed snapshots has been alleged to produce false positives. the advantages of rolling back to a previous Tumbleweed snapshot comes with the drawback that the user is no longer in sync with possible upcoming security fixes, which are shipped to target only the latest available snapshot. This tools is exclusively designed for Tumbleweed . If you have not already, please read the short introduction . tumbleweed-cli enables the user to control finely the update process by making explicit which Tumbleweed snapshot one is upgrading to. It also allows the user to select and rollback (or fast-forward) to any Tumbleweed snapshot comprised in a collection of recently released snapshots. Info In this paragraph snapshot is used to denote Tumbleweed snaphots unless qualified otherwise. Tumbleweed snapshots are \"slices\" coming out Factory -- the repository and production line for the Tumbleweed distribution. They consist of a collection of updates targeting a subset of all packages available. Do not conflate them with Btrfs snapshots , which are on-disk temporal stages of the file system. Both are discussed below. tumbleweed-cli may come in handy for users running into outstanding issues experienced with the latest or several snaphots across several snapshots -- including the latest one. It may be useful when three conditions occur: There is evidence that the cause(s) of the issue is one or several system packages; and The likely cause(s) \"spill over\" several single Btrfs snapshots including the latest one; and No previous Btrfs snapshot captures the state of the system which the user desires to rollback to. In addition to the \"recovery\" workflow described above, the user might use the tool preventively, by updating their system to a Tumbleweed snaphot located before the latest snapshot provided by Factory. Notice however that both the \"recovery\" and the preventive workflows could make your system unstable. This happens typically with packages provided by foreign repositories, which escape the scope of the rollbacks/fast-forwards mechanism. When foreign packages rely on dependences not or longer satisfied by the state of your system after rolling-back/fast-forwarding, they become unusable. Proceed only if you can accomodate these limitations. Installation and use \u2693\ufe0e To install tumbleweed-cli : zypper in tumbleweed-cli To intialize it: tumbleweed init The developer suggests to run this command to verify that the URLs of the repos contain a snapshot version: zypper lr -EUP Once this is done you can finally take advantage of the snapshotting system employed for producing Tumbleweed packages, keeping your system in sync with recent snapshot of your choice. Updating to the latest snapshot released is done with: tumbleweed update As explained above, packages installed from foreign repositories are not included in Tumbleweed snaphshots, and will not update when using tumbleweed-cli . For these packages you will still have to run (sudo zypper ref &&) sudo zypper dup . At any time you can then check the status of your system with respect to the latest snapshots released: tumbleweed status that returns for example: latest : 20210414 target : 20210414 installed: 20210414 where target refers to the next snapshot the system is going to update to with tumbleweed-update . Setting the target to the previous snapshot and reverting to it is performed with: tumbleweed revert --install or if the previous snapshot is for instance 20210411, the equivalent: tumbleweed switch 20210411 sudo zypper dup tumbleweed-switch is thus the more generic option allowing you to set the target to whichever snapshot you fancy, provided it is available.

Disk \u2693\ufe0e Suggested Partitioning \u2693\ufe0e Guided Setup \u2693\ufe0e Expert Partitioner \u2693\ufe0e About partition schemes \u2693\ufe0e Most Linux distributions use the same \"base\" partition scheme: a bootloader partition , hosting a small program called a bootloader , whose purpose is to take over from the UEFI/BIOS of your computer and set up the initial conditions for your operating system to get running a main data partition (or OS partition ), which is where the operating system (i.e. Leap ) is installed, optionally along with your personal user data. (recommended but not necessary) a swap partition of the size of your machine's RAM, + 1 GB If you are not interested in keeping whatever data or operating system is installed on the target machine, you can simply proceed with the base partition scheme. In that cases, simply run the installer and, on the Disk screen, pick the Suggested Partitioning option, and accept all recommendations there. Chances are, however, that you will want to install Leap on a disk with an already functional operating system (i.e. Windows, macOS, or another Linux distribution). Or that you will want to install more operating systems alongside Leap easily and reliably in the future. These families of scenarios require some extra steps with respect ot to the \"base\" partition scheme above. Installing Leap alongside preexistent Windows partitions \u2693\ufe0e If you have Windows installed already, you are likely to have the following (physical) partitions already: one 'recovery partition', about 500 MB large, usually using the Fat32 filesystem (we won't consider it further as it is not relevant to what comes next) one 'Windows data' partition, usually using the Fat32 filesystem, hosting both Windows and your user data (you want to leave it untouched) one 'Windows bootloader' partition, about 100 MB large, using the Fat32 filesystem, hosting the Windows bootloader. We recommend adding to these physical partitions a single 'Leap OS' partition, at least 40 GB large, using the Btrfs filesystem. Please scroll down to pick a filesystem for data partitions to for more details as to why we recommend Btrfs . Info The 'Leap OS' partition will host the Leap bootloader under the /boot subvolume, the operating system directly under / and your user data under the /home subvolume. Do note that, by default, a /home directory will be installed to store your user data. Also by default, this directory will be excluded from the snapshotting system, which means that there will be no Btrfs backups for your user data. This permits rollbacks between snapshots to proceed smoothly, leaving your user data in no incoherent state. This also means that you will need to manually manage your user data back ups . Alternatively, you might want to install your user data under a separate partition, also mounted as /home , using any file system of your liking. This might come in handy if you plan on using multiple operating systems reading from, and writing to, a single user data partition. Whichever option you choose, you can refer to the following instructions: Step by step: Expert partitioning for Windows From the Disk view, select Expert Partitioner Click the Add Partition button (bottom left-hand side) Assign it at least 40 GBs, and set its filesystem to Btrfs , and the mount point to / . You could label this partition 'Leap OS'. If it is not set already, set the /boot/efi flag your 'Windows bootloader' partition (the ~100MB partition probably using the Fat32 filesystem) (recommended) Add a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. Info Even though this makes no difference from the installer's point of view, we recommend assigning meaningful labels to each partition, to make them easier to reidentify them. The result should look like this: Check list: Expert partitioning for Windows (old) ... some other Windows partitions ... (old) /boot/efi , Fat32 , ~ 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Warning Because you are installing the Leap bootloader on a non-btrfs partition, the bootloader will be outside of the scope of the snapshotting system. This means that you won't be able to rollback from a misconfigured bootloader settings, and that in general rolling back won't suffice to fix issues with your bootloader configuration. See Introduction to snapper for details. Consider also the official documentation on snapper rollbacks. Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and Windows. Use these instructions to learn how to reboot to your UEFI. From there you will be able to select Windows or Leap as boot destination. Installing Leap alongside preexistent Linux partitions \u2693\ufe0e You can follow the Step by Step from the previous section, making sure that: you flag your already existent bootloader partition as /boot/efi (if it already exists on the disk before installing Leap ) you flag your user data partition as /home , or alternatively, that you apply steps (4 & 5) if you need to have a /home partition outside of / . Warning Make sure there is enough space (>100 MB is fine) on whatever partition you're installing your bootloader(s) to. Resize it if necessary. Check list: Expert partitioning for multiple Linux distributions (old) ... some other partitions ... (old) /boot/efi , preferably Btrfs , > 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and whichever operating system you're using. Refer to your machine's manufacturer for instructions. If your machine had Windows preinstalled, use these instructions to learn how to reboot to your UEFI. From there you will be able to select the desired boot destination. Installing Leap alongside preexistent macOS partitions \u2693\ufe0e The installation process for Mac users interested in dual-booting Leap alongside their mac OS partitions is simple: Step by step: Expert partitioning for Mac From the Disk view, select Expert Partitioner Click the Add Partition button (bottom left-hand side) Create a new Btrfs partition of at least 100 MB for the Leap bootloader. Set it the /boot/efi mount point. You could label this partition 'Leap bootloader'. Create a new Btrfs partition of at least 40 GBs by repeating (2). Set it the / mount point. You could label this partition 'Leap OS'. (recommended) Create a swap partition with a size equal to your current RAM + 1 GB. Check list: Expert partitioning for macOS (old) ... some macOS partitions ... (new) /boot/efi , Btrfs , > 100 MB (new) / , Btrfs , > 40 GB Optionally, you could create a new partition for your user data under /home . This partition would then be easily accessible to other operating systems installed on your machine. If you do so, make sure there is no /home subvolume created inside the partition assigned to / . Warning Some recent Macs have been reported to ship with firmware lock enabled by default. Refer to this guide to disable it. Info After the installation you will want to switch between Leap and macOS. Simply hold the alt (option) key immediately after restarting and select Leap or macOS. Picking a filesystem for data partitions \u2693\ufe0e The Leap installer allows you to pick among several filesystems for data partitions , which for the purpose of this section we define as any partition mounted as / (root) or having root on its path (i.e. /home ). Among the supported filesystems for data partitions you will find: Btrfs Ext4 XFS However, Btrfs has been the preferred filesystem for all openSUSE distributions for several years. This filesystem boasts a powerful copy-on-write logic, which lies at the heart of openSUSE's approach to stability: Btrfs allows to conveniently create and use snapshots , aka 'restoration points' on Windows (see Introduction to snapper for details). For this reason we highly recommend you to use it for all your data partitions when installing Leap . Info Snapshots take advantage of the copy-on-write logic of Btrfs . On a copy-on write filesystem, submitted changes do not overwrite the previous state; instead, changes are 'moved' to a different location on the disk, so that the location of origin is left unchanged. Together with 'deduplication' rules aimed at minimizing redundancies between file changes, this logic allows for the layering of several versions of an entire filesystem, with each layer representing different sets of changes. These sets of changes thus correspond to meaningful actions from the end user's perspective, such as 'before installing package X', 'before creating subvolume Y', etc. Renouncing Btrfs thus means renouncing this feature. Given that Tumbleweed was designed around this feature, it will not work as intended unless you pick this filesystem. LUKS encryption \u2693\ufe0e If you are installing Leap on a laptop, or generally on any machine accessible to untrusted individuals, we highly recommend protecting your data with a full disk encryption . The price to pay is that doing so will entirely wipe out your drive. The obvious advantage, however, is that this will protect your data with a sound security model. Info Full disk encryption contrasts with partition encryption in that it protects your entire physical drive using cryptographic techniques. For reasons that go beyond the scope of this document, partition encryption is significantly less secure than full disk encryption. In pictures, partition encryption is like locking your house with an old fashioned padlock and hiding the key in a flowerpot lying on the terrace, while full disk encryption is like locking your house with a digital padlock and keeping the code only in your mind. To apply full disk encryption while installing, you can either use the Guided Setup feature or manually create the partition scheme first and then apply encryption. If you do the latter, you can simply reproduce the steps listed below: Step by step: Guided partitioning for LUKS on Btrfs Select Guided Setup from the Disk screen Check Enable Disk Encryption , and enter a strong password in both text fields Then, on the Filesystem Options screen: Select Btrfs . Tick the Enable Snapshots checkbox ( scroll up or see this document to understand the reason why we recommend this). Select Btrfs again as File System Type for your any mount point / partition presented to you by the installer. Alternatively, if you prefer to turn to a different filesystem than Btrfs (typically Ext4 ) follow the following steps: Warning Using Ext4 on either / or /boot will prevent you from using snapper snapshots. Step by step (Guided Setup: LUKS + LVM + Ext4) Select Guided Setup ' from the _Disk screen Check Enable LVM ' and _Enable Disk Encryption , and enter a strong password in both text fields Then, on the Filesystem Options screen: Select Ext4 . Tick the Enable Snapshots checkbox ( scroll up or see this document to understand the reason why we recommend this). Tick the Propose Separate Home LVM Logical Volume checkbox. Select Ext4 again as File System Type for your /home directory. Tick the Propose Separate Swap LVM Logical Volume . Info The recommended setup mentioned here makes use of the cryptsetup utility in conjunction with an LVM partition. cryptsetup is a popular and trusted tool in the Linux community implementing the LUKS Linux kernel standard, using the aes-xts-plain64 encryption standard. As for LVM, it is a partitioning scheme that allows your machine to see multiple physical disks as one single (logical) partition, or vice-versa, to see one unique physical disk as multiple (logical) partitions. LVM & LUKS work well together, with LVM considerably simplifying encryption - decryption operations. Time Zone \u2693\ufe0e Clock and Time Zone \u2693\ufe0e Select your region and the time zone that you want to use for the system. The hardware clock is by default set to UTC. Select Other Settings for other time settings: Manually : Set time and date manually. Synchronize with NTP Server : Automatically synchronize time and date with the provided NTP servers which you can initiate right now by selecting \"Synchronize now\" . Run NTP as daemon : Run NTP as a daemon so the service always runs and starts automatically on boot and sets the time and date based on the received values from the NTP server. Save NTP Configuration : save or discard the NTP configuration into the installed system. User Settings \u2693\ufe0e Local User \u2693\ufe0e At this point you can create a local user or skip that by selecting Skip User Creation you can set up a password for root . You need to fill out the empty fields in order to create a first user: User's Full Name : A human-friendly version of your username, which will be shown in login windows for example. Username : The actual username for your account. This will be used in all login contexts, whether dialogue boxes or terminal prompts, including virtual console (vc) or over Secure Shell (SSH). Password : The password for your user to secure your account. By default you will also use this newly created account to act as the administrator. The password set there will be set for the root user as well. Root user openSUSE creates the root user by default, in contrast to other Linux distributions. To avoid using the same password for both users, untick the Use this password for system administrator checkbox. Clicking Next will take you to the page where you can set a different password for root. At this page you can also import existing SSH public keys. This is useful if you're installing openSUSE over another distribution. Installation \u2693\ufe0e Installation Overview \u2693\ufe0e Installation Settings \u2693\ufe0e This is the final and probably the an important section of the installer, don't skip it !

Select Btrfs again as File System Type for your any mount point / partition presented to you by the installer. Alternatively, if you prefer to turn to a different filesystem than Btrfs (typically Ext4 ) follow the following steps: Warning Using Ext4 on either / or /boot will prevent you from using snapper snapshots. Step by step (Guided Setup: LUKS + LVM + Ext4) Select Guided Setup ' from the _Disk screen Check Enable LVM ' and _Enable Disk Encryption , and enter a strong password in both text fields Then, on the Filesystem Options screen: Select Ext4 .

Select Ext4 again as File System Type for your /home directory. Tick the Propose Separate Swap LVM Logical Volume . Info The recommended setup mentioned here makes use of the cryptsetup utility in conjunction with an LVM partition. cryptsetup is a popular and trusted tool in the Linux community implementing the LUKS Linux kernel standard, using the aes-xts-plain64 encryption standard. As for LVM, it is a partitioning scheme that allows your machine to see multiple physical disks as one single (logical) partition, or vice-versa, to see one unique physical disk as multiple (logical) partitions. LVM & LUKS work well together, with LVM considerably simplifying encryption - decryption operations.","title":"LUKS encryption"},{"location":"yast_installer/#time-zone","text":"","title":"Time Zone"},{"location":"yast_installer/#clock-and-time-zone","text":"Select your region and the time zone that you want to use for the system.

It also manages repositories, can perform various queries, and is a command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp). Show Definitions repository Local or remote directory containing packages and various package information (package metadata). package Software package (RPM package, source package). Patches, patterns, and products are also commonly referred to as different types of packages. patch Represents a package or a group of packages needed to install an update (a bug fix mostly). pattern Represents a group of packages. For example an Http Server pattern would have the dependencies defined so that all packages needed to run and manage an http server would have been triggered for installation when upon installing the pattern. product Represents the whole product (e.g. 'openSUSE Leap 15.3'). What is a Package Manager? \u2693\ufe0e Software is incredibly interconnected. Programming a user interface, a developer's code will specify the location on the screen of widgets, such as buttons or text, and define how these things rearrange when a window is resized. But most code depends on some other code that serves as a 'backend' (often called a library ). For example, an application will rarely describe how to render a button, instead it will ask a library to do that for it. This allows for a number of benefits. Some people specialise on writing button drawing routines while others specialise on using those routines to create feature-full applications. Apps written for Linux use this principle a lot and it opens up a lot of opportunity. If 100 apps all use the same library, we could install that library once and all 100 apps could use that single copy when running. This has the following benefits: We save space! Instead of every graphical application containing the code necessary for drawing a button, we have that code installed once! If a library used by many is found to contain insecure, buggy or slow code, you can fix and update the library and every app that uses it gains that improvement. We don't have to rely on developers tracking the libraries that they use and rebuilding their apps every time one changes. If you improve upon a library in some way, you can exchange the version on your computer with your modified version. Your improvment is then available to all applications that use that library and can adopt your changes. This is a core principle in free software . However, there is a drawback. When installing software, we have to ensure that the libraries that it requires (known as dependencies) are also installed. When removing software, we cannot remove a dependency without checking to make sure that nothing else depends upon it -- or it will break the 'dependency-tree' of the operating system. To visualize the issue, consider the following illustration: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB Let's assume for simplicity that no other software requires lib4 . Under this assumption, if the user remove softwareB, they will want to remove lib4 , but neither lib3 nor lib6 , because the former is directly required by softwareA , while the latter is indirectly required by softwareA via lib3 . In addition to this issue imagine the user updates softwareB so that it ends up depending on a new version of library lib4 , say lib4* . This means that we need to recast the above structure as: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 lib4* \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB(updated) This means that the system must be able to 'see through' the actual versions of each package, so as to understand the path of their dependencies and warn about required alterations. These problems are solved with a package manager. Developers can build applications, libraries and many other things into packages that contain what you want install and a set of references to any other packages that it depends upon. The package manager is an essential piece of software that downloads, installs, uninstalls and updates packages for you. If you tell the package manager to install Firefox, it will download a package containing the firefox executable, as well as a number of packages that contain the dependencies of Firefox. It also holds a database of all installed packages so it knows when it can uninstall certain dependencies without breaking software on your computer. Zypper is the name of the package manager used by openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux. Usage \u2693\ufe0e Zypper is a command line tool, meaning that it is used from within the terminal. Installing, updating and removing packages are operations that affect all users on the system and so many of these commands will not work unless they are run as a privileged user. Although special permissions can be granted to individual user accounts, it is simpler to run commands as the root user (the user with the most privilege). Prefixing a command with sudo (e.g. sudo zypper install firefox ) will ask for the password of the root user account and then runs the command as root . Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command. See zypper help for a list of general options and all commands. To get help for a specific command, type zypper help command # zypper [--GLOBAL-OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] # zypper <SUBCOMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]` Note Whenever Zypper needs input, it lists possible answers in brackets next to the prompt text. To choose the default answer, press < Enter > (the default answer is printed in capitals, with the exception of non-ascii characters). Some prompts also have help available, in which case there is a question mark '?' listed as a possible answer. To make Zypper use the default answers without user interaction, use the --non-interactive global option. Commands \u2693\ufe0e A single command is given to zypper (without a leading -- ) to instruct it on what kind of task it should do. For example zypper install instructs zypper that we want to install something and zypper search instructs zypper that we want to search for a package. Tip The most used zypper commands have shorter aliases; for example, zypper in is the same as zypper install . zypper without any commands or arguments will print a list of commands and options. This manual is a great starting point but it does not cover all possible ways to use zypper. If you want to see all of the options that can be given to each subcommand in zypper, type: zypper <COMMAND> -h and it will show all of the different ways of configuring the command specified in an easy to read way. The Basics \u2693\ufe0e Installing packages \u2693\ufe0e To install a package type: # zypper install packagename or # zypper in packagename This will download the package you specified along with all of its dependencies and install them. If you want to install more than one package, you simply list them all: # zypper in package_1 package_2 ... package_n Searching for packages \u2693\ufe0e In order to install a package, you need to know its name. To search the repositories for a package type: # zypper search packagename or # zypper se packagename This will return a list of packages that contain your search string along with a summary, a type and whether they have been installed. Example: Search for Firefox # zypper se firefox Loading repository data... Reading installed packages...

Zypper will already have a few added (the default for either Tumbleweed or Leap) but there are many reasons why you might want to add some more. You might need to install proprietary libraries such as cuda or non-free media codecs. To add a new repository type: zypper addrepo https://somerepo.com/something name or zypper ar https://somerepo.com/something [optional-name] If successful, zypper will report the settings of that repo: URI of the repository If the repository is enabled If the repository will be GPG checked The priority Understanding The Output Enabled / Disabled If a repository is disabled, it means that zypper still knows where it is but will not use it. You can enable repositories globally or for single commands. GPG check If a repository has GPG checks enabled, it means that your computer will save a key, which you will be asked if you trust it the first time you use a repository. After downloading a package, zypper will use this key to make sure that the download succeeded and the package is not corrupted. It also verifies that the package is authentic. If a hacker intercepts a package download in an attempt to load malicious software onto your computer, the evil package will fail the GPG check. Priority If two repositories contain the same package and you ask zypper to install it, it will automatically use a repository with a higher priority (lower number). Autorefresh If autorefresh is on, zypper will automatically download a fresh list of packages from the repository to ensure that it isn't going to give you out of date information or packages. Example: Adding the cuda Leap repo # sudo zypper ar https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/opensuse15/x86_64/cuda-opensuse15.repo cuda [sudo] password for root: Adding repository 'cuda' ..................................................................................[done] Repository 'cuda' successfully added URI : https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/opensuse15/x86_64 Enabled : Yes GPG Check : Yes Autorefresh : No Priority : 99 (default priority) Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority. Removing Repositories \u2693\ufe0e You might decide that you no longer need a repository. Maybe you broke your nvidia graphics card and feel that having the cuda repository just slows down zypper operations. You can remove a repository typing # zypper removerepo reponame or # zypper rr reponame Example: Removing the cuda repository # sudo zypper rr cuda [sudo] password for root: Removing repository 'cuda' ...............................................[done] Repository 'cuda' has been removed. Listing Repositories \u2693\ufe0e To list all of the installed repositories type: # zypper repos # zypper lr This will display a table containing information and names of all the added repos Example: Listing repositories # zypper lr Repository priorities are without effect. All enabled repositories share the same priority. # | Alias | Name | Enabled | GPG Check | Refresh --+-------------------+---------------------------+---------+-----------+-------- 1 | repo-debug | Debug Repository | No | ---- | ---- 2 | repo-debug-update | Update Repository (Debug) | No | ---- | ---- 3 | repo-oss | Main Repository | Yes | (r ) Yes | Yes 4 | repo-source | Source Repository | No | ---- | ---- 5 | repo-update | Main Update Repository | Yes | (r ) Yes | Yes Info See the info box in Adding a New Repository to understand the output Removing Packages \u2693\ufe0e Sometimes you will want to remove packages. To achieve this, type: # zypper remove package or # zypper rm package Tip If your aim is to save space, you may want to add -u or --clean-deps e.g. sudo zypper rm -u firefox to remove the unneeded dependencies as well. Just like when installing, you can remove multiple packages at a time: # zypper rm package_1 package_2 ... package_n Refreshing your repositories \u2693\ufe0e Your computer stores a list of packages that each repository provides and metadata to help it work out what each package depends on. This is so that when you instruct zypper to do something, it can calculate the steps it will take without having to make many slow web requests. For some repositories, this offline list is automatically kept up to date (called autorefresh), but a lot of the time you will want to update this offline list yourself. Before updating, after adding a repository and before installing a package it is a good idea to update this list. You update it by typing: # zypper refresh or # zypper ref Updating Your Computer \u2693\ufe0e There are three different types of update that you can do with zypper Standard Update Patch Updates Distro Upgrade Standard updates simply check to see if newer versions of your packages exist in the repository. If there is a newer version, it will download and install it. Patches are groups of package updates. They are categorised so that you can see why they are being updated. For example, often, when you ask zypper to list available patches, some will be labeled as security patches. This means that they fix a certain security problem that has been discovered in some packages on your system. Distro upgrades do not only update the packages on your system, but also change the source that you get your packages from. This is used mostly on Tumbleweed. The build server where Tumbleweed packages are built is a bit chaotic; packages are updated at an extremely high speed. A consequence of this is that incompatibilities between new packages emerge all over the place. So how does Tumbleweed stay so stable? In regular intervals, a stable snapshot of the Tumbleweed packages is found and frozen for a short amount of time. Tumbleweed users use the distro upgrade feature of zypper to get their updates and so they change their distribution to the newest snapshot. This means that zypper changes repositories to point to the newer snapshot, and then updates all the packages with respect to the new snapshot. This means that Tumbleweed users can enjoy incredibly up to date packages without having to deal with too much instability. Distro-upgrades can be used by leap users to upgrade version (for example, upgrading Leap 15.1 to 15.2). See here for more details. Don't be intimidated by the number of options available to you for updating. The golden rule is if you are on Tumbleweed, do distro-upgrades and if you are on leap do normal upgrades. The exception to this rule is if you are in charge of a production system, such as a web-server (or any system where the only things scarier than change are security issues) then use patches to ensure that only the minimum amount of your system is touched by updates. Listing Updates \u2693\ufe0e To list all of packages that have updates waiting for them, type: # zypper list-updates or # zypper lu Zypper will print out a table that shows you the updatable packages, the repos they come from, the installed versions and the available versions. Example: Listing updates # zypper lu Loading repository data... Reading installed packages...

Programming a user interface, a developer's code will specify the location on the screen of widgets, such as buttons or text, and define how these things rearrange when a window is resized. But most code depends on some other code that serves as a 'backend' (often called a library ). For example, an application will rarely describe how to render a button, instead it will ask a library to do that for it. This allows for a number of benefits. Some people specialise on writing button drawing routines while others specialise on using those routines to create feature-full applications. Apps written for Linux use this principle a lot and it opens up a lot of opportunity. If 100 apps all use the same library, we could install that library once and all 100 apps could use that single copy when running. This has the following benefits: We save space! Instead of every graphical application containing the code necessary for drawing a button, we have that code installed once! If a library used by many is found to contain insecure, buggy or slow code, you can fix and update the library and every app that uses it gains that improvement. We don't have to rely on developers tracking the libraries that they use and rebuilding their apps every time one changes. If you improve upon a library in some way, you can exchange the version on your computer with your modified version. Your improvment is then available to all applications that use that library and can adopt your changes. This is a core principle in free software . However, there is a drawback. When installing software, we have to ensure that the libraries that it requires (known as dependencies) are also installed. When removing software, we cannot remove a dependency without checking to make sure that nothing else depends upon it -- or it will break the 'dependency-tree' of the operating system. To visualize the issue, consider the following illustration: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB Let's assume for simplicity that no other software requires lib4 . Under this assumption, if the user remove softwareB, they will want to remove lib4 , but neither lib3 nor lib6 , because the former is directly required by softwareA , while the latter is indirectly required by softwareA via lib3 . In addition to this issue imagine the user updates softwareB so that it ends up depending on a new version of library lib4 , say lib4* . This means that we need to recast the above structure as: lib5 lib6 / \\ / \\ lib1 lib3 lib4 lib4* \\ / \\ / softwareA softwareB(updated) This means that the system must be able to 'see through' the actual versions of each package, so as to understand the path of their dependencies and warn about required alterations. These problems are solved with a package manager. Developers can build applications, libraries and many other things into packages that contain what you want install and a set of references to any other packages that it depends upon. The package manager is an essential piece of software that downloads, installs, uninstalls and updates packages for you. If you tell the package manager to install Firefox, it will download a package containing the firefox executable, as well as a number of packages that contain the dependencies of Firefox. It also holds a database of all installed packages so it knows when it can uninstall certain dependencies without breaking software on your computer. Zypper is the name of the package manager used by openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux.","title":"What is a Package Manager?"},{"location":"zypper/#usage","text":"Zypper is a command line tool, meaning that it is used from within the terminal. Installing, updating and removing packages are operations that affect all users on the system and so many of these commands will not work unless they are run as a privileged user. Although special permissions can be granted to individual user accounts, it is simpler to run commands as the root user (the user with the most privilege). Prefixing a command with sudo (e.g. sudo zypper install firefox ) will ask for the password of the root user account and then runs the command as root . Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command. See zypper help for a list of general options and all commands. To get help for a specific command, type zypper help command # zypper [--GLOBAL-OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] # zypper <SUBCOMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]` Note Whenever Zypper needs input, it lists possible answers in brackets next to the prompt text. To choose the default answer, press < Enter > (the default answer is printed in capitals, with the exception of non-ascii characters). Some prompts also have help available, in which case there is a question mark '?' listed as a possible answer. To make Zypper use the default answers without user interaction, use the --non-interactive global option.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"zypper/#commands","text":"A single command is given to zypper (without a leading -- ) to instruct it on what kind of task it should do.

Zypper will already have a few added (the default for either Tumbleweed or Leap) but there are many reasons why you might want to add some more. You might need to install proprietary libraries such as cuda or non-free media codecs. To add a new repository type: zypper addrepo https://somerepo.com/something name or zypper ar https://somerepo.com/something [optional-name] If successful, zypper will report the settings of that repo: URI of the repository If the repository is enabled If the repository will be GPG checked The priority Understanding The Output Enabled / Disabled If a repository is disabled, it means that zypper still knows where it is but will not use it. You can enable repositories globally or for single commands. GPG check If a repository has GPG checks enabled, it means that your computer will save a key, which you will be asked if you trust it the first time you use a repository. After downloading a package, zypper will use this key to make sure that the download succeeded and the package is not corrupted. It also verifies that the package is authentic. If a hacker intercepts a package download in an attempt to load malicious software onto your computer, the evil package will fail the GPG check. Priority If two repositories contain the same package and you ask zypper to install it, it will automatically use a repository with a higher priority (lower number). Autorefresh If autorefresh is on, zypper will automatically download a fresh list of packages from the repository to ensure that it isn't going to give you out of date information or packages.

For some repositories, this offline list is automatically kept up to date (called autorefresh), but a lot of the time you will want to update this offline list yourself. Before updating, after adding a repository and before installing a package it is a good idea to update this list. You update it by typing: # zypper refresh or # zypper ref","title":"Refreshing your repositories"},{"location":"zypper/#updating-your-computer","text":"There are three different types of update that you can do with zypper Standard Update Patch Updates Distro Upgrade Standard updates simply check to see if newer versions of your packages exist in the repository. If there is a newer version, it will download and install it. Patches are groups of package updates. They are categorised so that you can see why they are being updated. For example, often, when you ask zypper to list available patches, some will be labeled as security patches. This means that they fix a certain security problem that has been discovered in some packages on your system. Distro upgrades do not only update the packages on your system, but also change the source that you get your packages from. This is used mostly on Tumbleweed. The build server where Tumbleweed packages are built is a bit chaotic; packages are updated at an extremely high speed. A consequence of this is that incompatibilities between new packages emerge all over the place. So how does Tumbleweed stay so stable? In regular intervals, a stable snapshot of the Tumbleweed packages is found and frozen for a short amount of time. Tumbleweed users use the distro upgrade feature of zypper to get their updates and so they change their distribution to the newest snapshot. This means that zypper changes repositories to point to the newer snapshot, and then updates all the packages with respect to the new snapshot. This means that Tumbleweed users can enjoy incredibly up to date packages without having to deal with too much instability. Distro-upgrades can be used by leap users to upgrade version (for example, upgrading Leap 15.1 to 15.2). See here for more details. Don't be intimidated by the number of options available to you for updating. The golden rule is if you are on Tumbleweed, do distro-upgrades and if you are on leap do normal upgrades. The exception to this rule is if you are in charge of a production system, such as a web-server (or any system where the only things scarier than change are security issues) then use patches to ensure that only the minimum amount of your system is touched by updates.","title":"Updating Your Computer"},{"location":"zypper/#listing-updates","text":"To list all of packages that have updates waiting for them, type: # zypper list-updates or # zypper lu Zypper will print out a table that shows you the updatable packages, the repos they come from, the installed versions and the available versions.

Install packages with specified capabilities or RPM files with specified location. A capability is NAME[.ARCH][OP<VERSION>], where OP is one of <, <=, =, >=, >. Command options: -t, --type <TYPE> Type of package (package, patch, pattern, product). -n, --name Select packages by plain name, not by capability. Default: false -C, --capability Select packages solely by capability. Default: false --details Show the detailed installation summary. Default: false --from <ALIAS|#|URI> Select packages from the specified repository. --oldpackage Allow to replace a newer item with an older one. Handy if you are doing a rollback. Unlike --force it will not enforce a reinstall. Default: false --allow-unsigned-rpm Silently install unsigned rpm packages given as commandline parameters. Default: false -f, --force Install even if the item is already installed (reinstall), downgraded or changes vendor or architecture. Default: false -r, --repo <ALIAS|#|URI> Work only with the specified repository. -y, --no-confirm Don't require user interaction. Alias for the --non-interactive global option. Default: false -D, --dry-run Don't change anything, just report what would be done. A meaningful file conflict check can only be performed if used together with '--download-only'. Default: false --replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. --download-as-needed disables the fileconflict check. Default: false -l, --auto-agree-with-licenses Automatically say 'yes' to third party license confirmation prompt. See 'man zypper' for more details. Default: false --download <MODE> Set the download-install mode. Available modes: only, in-advance, in-heaps, as-needed Default: DownloadDefault -d, --download-only Only download the packages, do not install. Solver options --debug-solver Create a solver test case for debugging. --force-resolution Force the solver to find a solution (even an aggressive one) rather than asking. -R, --no-force-resolution Do not force the solver to find a solution, let it ask. --solver-focus <MODE> Set the solvers general attitude when resolving a job. --recommends Install also recommended packages in addition to the required ones. --no-recommends Do not install recommended packages, only required ones. Expert options --allow-downgrade --no-allow-downgrade Whether to allow downgrading installed resolvables. --allow-name-change --no-allow-name-change Whether to allow changing the names of installed
