## Foreword
This documentation is curated and maintained by openSUSE volunteers. The contents offered here should be sharply distinguished from the Leap documentation also available at https://doc.opensuse.org. Leap manuals inherit the contents from, and closely follow the presentation of, SLE manuals -- a commercial product offered by SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH. Three key differences should always be borne in mind:

1. The present documentation is the work of volunteers working according to the Free and Open Source Software tradition. This means that our best efforts notwithstanding, inaccuracies and oversights are possible. When this happens the best course of action is to report them to us, and ideally to submit proposals of improvements.

2. The present documentation describes procedures with software present in Factory -- the QA target & production line of the openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution. Even though Factory is thoroughly scrutinized by maintainers and engineers, not every combination of software present in Factory and procedures can be supported by SUSE employees or openSUSE volunteers. This means that the reader is expected to take at face value the disclaimers and admonitions provided in this documentation. They have been placed to provide as safe as possible a path to walk along.

3. As a consequence of Tumbleweed's following a 'rolling' release model, software and procedures evolve significantly faster than their Leap equivalents. Even though we try to respond as quick as possible to recent changes, the reader is expected to have some tolerance in cases parts of ours contents do not yet reflect the most recent updates to Factory.

## Audience
### New users
The documentation is laid out in a user friendly way. It caters to beginners and other people new to Linux, and helps you get running quickly. Installing Linux can seem daunting at first, because there are a lot of new concepts, choices, and options. Choice is good, but it can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.

Initially, the installation instruction will cover only the necessary options and configuration choices to help you quickly set up a running system with defaults suitable for daily use. With the system running and productive you can learn how to perform different routine system tasks such as installing apps, adjusting the system settings, or customizing openSUSE. And, if you're so inclined, start honing your Linux skills.

### Experienced users
For experienced Linux users the documentation includes short pointers on how things are done in
openSUSE and how things are different to other Linux distros. Links to advanced topics are provided to get you acquainted with the system, and quickly up and running.

## Summary
This documentation has three main parts. Each part (and most sections within it) can be read independently from the rest and can be used as a guide for accomplishing a specific task. However we have tried to make each part into a coherent whole, which can thus be read in a more linear fashion, in the order in which the contents are presented.

### Part I: Before installing
The pre-install documentation gives you everything you need to get a system running. This can be a simple installation using default settings, or you can make a few choices, such as choosing a desktop environment. You can find out more about things like desktop environments in this section.

__Choosing a distribution__

For experienced users, this section describes what differentiates openSUSE from other distros, and helps you get to know the unique features and make informed choices during the install process.

__Preparing the installation media__

All you need to know to download, verify and install an Installation Image, as well as prepare and boot to the installation media.

### Part II: Installation

__Step by step guide__

Now that you have a plan, this section will walk you through preparing installation media, and performing the installation based on the choice you made during pre-install.

### Part III: Post installation

__Distro basics__

This part contains walk-throughs for the different features of Linux in general and openSUSE in particular. It covers the user interface, system settings, installing and upgrading software, and general good computing practices. You will also learn how to use unique openSUSE features like YaST and snapshots. It is broken down into several main sections:

- KDE Plasma basics
- GNOME basics
- Interlude -- Fundamental openSUSE concepts
- Additional software
- Troubleshooting with autonomy

__Completing and fine-tuning your setup__

- Audio & Video:
- Graphic Drivers: 
- Setting up a containerized environment
- Power management: power.md
- Pairing, syncing, sharing
- Advanced fine-tunings
